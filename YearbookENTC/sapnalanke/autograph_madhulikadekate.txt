Dear Gee, 
We have known each other for 4 years and I still  feel I haven’t had enough time with you. You have cared for me, helped me whenever I needed you the most, cuddle and snuggled me ;). I don’t know if we were meant to be with each other, but I won’t ever lose you. Hostel life wouldn't be same without you, we have made so many memories and I'm so grateful for that. You are precious to me. You have taught me a lot and I thank you for that. Stay happy. Stay blessed. I wish for a very bright future for you. I love you more <3
