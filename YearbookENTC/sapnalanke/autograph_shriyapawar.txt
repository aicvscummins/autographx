No amount of words I write for you will ever be enough, you're a beautiful person❤️. From hardly knowing each other for two years to becoming such good friends is a journey only we both understand. I can't imagine not coming and sitting with you cause I'm bored, studying together, teaching each other stuff even if theirs so much to do cribbing to you about my life problems and listening to yours, thank you for being such a good friend, you take care of everyone and that's rare, I love you so much.Im glad we're always going to have each other. All the best for your life, you have a lot to do ahead❤️
