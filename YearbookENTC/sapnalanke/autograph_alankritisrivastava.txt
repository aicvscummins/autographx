Sapna..ab kya hi bolun tere baare mein. I’m so glad you became the CR. I think that is the reason you and I are such good friends. I remember calling each other to decide who was going to attend the unlimited list of meetings. I think the best experience we’ve had together is when we had to go see the third-year group dance which never happened for various reasons. You were always the more calm, sweet and patient person amongst the two of us. I remember losing my shit or screaming at people and then you’d come and save the day.  Oh! There were also the times when we spoke because I called Shriya or you called her. 3rd and 4th year could have not been the same without you. I couldn’t have asked for a better CR to work with. Even though we’ve never hung out together out of college, you are a really really good friend to me and you’ll be an important character in my engineering stories. I’ve always got your back <3
Please stay in touch! I’d really like us to be a part of each other’s lives .All the best for everything!
PS: You always were the better and more responsible CR.
