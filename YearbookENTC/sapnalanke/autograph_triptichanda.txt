Hey Sapna!
It was great meeting you and I wish that we had spent more time together. I know how close you were to Pooja and Sanika and that's how I know we would have loved hanging out together.
Your work as the CR of the class was genuinely awesome because you did everything that you could to make the college life bearable.
All the best!
