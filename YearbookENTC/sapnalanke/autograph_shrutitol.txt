Hey Sapna,
                   I don't think we even talked to each other in first 3 years. I also had a doubt if you could justify the position of CR.But you undoubtedly proved to be a very good leader...be it uniting people for mass bunk or answering teachers on behalf of all the people.Also it was fun to do all the maniquin challenge video with you...You were very supportive in the whole procedure.It wasn't possible without you.
Stay in touch.All the best!
