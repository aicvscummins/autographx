Hey Anshu! 
I still remember you were the very first person in college I interacted with,in the mech building outside one of the classrooms. 
You've always been super helpful with everything,  thanks for sharing all the notes and taking our mini tutorial sessions, it's been really great knowing someone so pretty and so down to earth like you! 
Wish you a life full of great things ahead :)
