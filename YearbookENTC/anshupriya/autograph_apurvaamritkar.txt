Hey Anshu, 
I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone so sweet and helpful in my entire 21 years of existence hahah. I love how you’re always ready to help people regardless of any other factor. I definitely think you were the best practical and study buddy I’ve had in college. I don’t think anyone else would’ve managed to keep me focused at a stretch as you have hahah. I remember last semester when we literally spent like hours studying together for the vlsi viva so that we’d finish studying. You are such a blessing and such an amazing friend. I will definitely miss you and don’t you dare forget me and the annoying ways I used to bother you at times. I truly hope the best for you and that all your dreams come true! 
Love you, 
Apurva
P.S. keep in touch (call me, text me whenever <3)
