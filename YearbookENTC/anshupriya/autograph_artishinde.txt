Hiii Ansuu!
Our journey from school to college is just exceptional and I must say there is absolutely no substitute for you. On the first day of college when everybody looks around for a friend in the pool of unfamiliar faces, I found myself the blessed one because I already have the bestest one standing by my side. You were always there for me. I think we have made a wonderful connection between us as most of the time we think alike and act. 


You are the most sensible friend in my life who very well knows how to tackle any sort of people and problem. I am glad to have a best friend like you and can proudly say you are no longer just bestie but my extended family.
We have made so many cherishable memories together and will continue to make more. Just stay as you are and I hope when you will relocate to Hyderabad our friendship will bloom more immensely and keep missing me. 
At last, I would say keep working hard and wish you all the best for your future endeavors and keep in mind I am always always there for you.


With lots of love
Your RTI :)
