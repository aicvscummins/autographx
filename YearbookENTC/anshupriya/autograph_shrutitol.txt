Hey Anshu(sorry sorry "Anshu space Priya"),
 I still remember how I used to ask you frequently about your name and then why don't you have surname...All stupidity...And you answered me patiently everytime.
Our bond started from ROBOCON. You were the " Bluetooth" team and used to work really hard on the same. From that to having rides to Raajiv  to me forcing you to try some street food everytime we went out to me  driving your scooty cause you liked to be driven by someone else..We have came so far.
You are that pretty, witty little fellow in the class who is admired by everyone.
Love you.Stay in touch.
~Shruti☺️
