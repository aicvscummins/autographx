Hey Anshu!
I don't even know where to begin with you. We have spent so many amazing times together even before we joined this college. I am pretty sure that I met you on the day we got our admission, and I am not going to lie, my mom has loved you since that day so automatic seal of approval.
You are the kindest and sweetest person I have ever met. The way that you go out of your way to help the people around you and make sure that everyone feels better just by being in the same room as you is inspirational to say the least.
You were a pillar of support during Robocon and a great friend before and after. It has been a privilege knowing you and I hope that we keep in touch. All the best!
