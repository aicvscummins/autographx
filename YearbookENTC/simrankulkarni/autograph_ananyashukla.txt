Simraaaaan,
One of my first friends in college. I'm glad we stayed friends till the end. We went from random bike rides in FY to car drives in BE. Crashing at your place to meet Oreo was the best part though :P
How did you manage to reach half of the syllabus before I even started? :O I remember how we'd  be in a loop of "send notes" before every exam and ultimately just give up and sleep xD
Hoping to stay in touch with you. Lots of love <3
