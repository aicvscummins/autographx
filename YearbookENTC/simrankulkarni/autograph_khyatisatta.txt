Hey Simran,
We didn't get to bond much but first year was the best part of my college life and you were such a big part of it.
Unsurprisingly, the memory which strikes up is the tonnes of Chinese food we ate in the first year(No exaggeration there)
Hope you a great life ahead
Cheers and stay in touch
