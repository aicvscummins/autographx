Hey simran, do you remember our avionics days xD?
That was fun. And the last ESE exam of avionics, thanks to you I got some extra marks. How brilliantly you showed me stuff even on the first bench.
Simran, the initiative you're taking in the lockdown for the street dogs and how nice of you to take so much effort really inspires me. Please stay in touch:)
All the best.
