Simran!!
When am I going to come over and spend time with Oreo? :'( 
You're awesome! I'm always going to remember spending the entire of our first year in the college canteen eating Chinese :p
 I love how thoughtful and considerate you are towards others feelings and can't wait for your wedding, I'm sure it's going to be the first one. Let's always stay in touch <3
