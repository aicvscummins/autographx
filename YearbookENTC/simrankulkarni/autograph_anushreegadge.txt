Hey Simran!
We have never talked throughout our four years but i wish we would have ! Bcoz we have soo much in common! I am an animal lover just like you and i too have pets at home. I think we would have had great conversations on the same! I have always admired how u took a stand against animal cruelty and tried to do ur bit in making the lives of these animals better! I wish u all the very best for ur future! And i hope all ur dreams come true!


With love,
Anushree:)
