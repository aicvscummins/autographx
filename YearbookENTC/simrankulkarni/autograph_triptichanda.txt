Hey Simran!
I know we didn't hang out much but I will never forget you. I don't know if you remember this but you gave me something in my first year.
It had been one of the most aweful days and I had just been playing around with one of those wooden figurines that you had on your pouch. You asked me if I wanted one and when I said yes, you got me one the very next day, no questions asked.
That action changed everything for me and brought me a lot of happiness. I still carry that around everyday on my backpack to remind me how that one act of kindness made everything so much better.
I hope someone does the same for you and nobody deserves it more.
All the best!
