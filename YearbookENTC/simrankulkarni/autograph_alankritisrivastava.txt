Simran! We’ve known each other for a long time now. Whether it was eating Chinese in the canteen, getting ready for the fashion show or just panicking before the Avionics exam. I wish we’d spend some more time to bond one on one. But it is great knowing you. Stay in touch! All the best for everything!
