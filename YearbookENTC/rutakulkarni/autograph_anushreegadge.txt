Hey Ruta!
The small trip we had to IUCAA was extremely fun and i could get a break from the day only bcoz u , coz u came up with the idea! And not to forget the Goa trip was planned by u too(*which we unfortunately couldnt go to bcoz of the covid situation)
But I can only imagine how fun it would have been if we would have been close 
friends since Fy !
I will forever remember ur phone call pranks that u did on random ppl from our class!They were hilarious! U are just a fun person to be with! I hope we still stay in touch! Heres wishing u very best for the years ahead!  Stay the way you are ! Cheers!
