Yo babes,
I don't exactly remember how we became friends.It was probably Harry Potter.
We'll be the oldies singing Hogwarts Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts and trying our hand at DADA.
And of course cracking "jokes" on purely innocent things.
We are the Fed and Geroge who lived.
P.S. I promise to not ignore you. Ever.
