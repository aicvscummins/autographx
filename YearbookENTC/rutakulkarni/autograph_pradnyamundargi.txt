Ruta you've been my lab partner since forever. We have always bluffed our way through and then laughed about our meetings with Kamble Ma'am. We've had some amazing and candid discussions on Space to random project ideas which were never exceuted. I don't think I would have enjoyed any of my lab sessions as much, if it wouldn't have been for you. Stay in touch and good luck <3
