Hi Ruta!
We have so many boundless memories together, the practicals, Viva, Labs turned out fun with you (especially our jugaad for VLSI & uC). Then we worked together for our mini project & even that journey was amazing, Right now I am laughing 😄😂remembering the movement we went to buy lemon juice🥤 for kajal.
We didn't go for our final year trip but the night out at Rajgad has definitely given a sense of satisfaction.
You are very Cool, I feel lucky to have a friend like you by my side. Thank you for everything.
Be in touch…..lots of love to you ❤️ and yummy fruit Shrikhand🥫
