Hey Radiant Ruta!

You are a source of Positive energy, radiating good vibes only. But during exam time, you radiate study vibes!! Which is good, but we all get tensed looking at your preparation and notes. Your notes are difficult to understand for me because you know how bad your handwriting is! 😜 How do you manage to study everything?? and also the stuff which is out of syllabus?? 
Tip: Always draw diagrams wherever possible. At least when asked.😂

Girl, I have seen your transformation from a tomboy to a magnet. Yes, you are a magnet! Remember MOOD INDIGO?? With time, I hope you get a better sense of differentiating straight and crooked encounters. 
We have a lot of memories to treasure for life! Journey with you was magical not any less adventurous than a Hogwarts experience. Cheers to all those night outs, movies, bunks, trips, spontaneous plans, double meaning jokes, exam ki tayari and all the moments spent together.💖

PS: A secret message for you in Rahul Subramanian's language: Andu Gondu Andu Gondu Andu Gondu❤❤❤
