Hey Rutya  (My far fetched sister),
        Remember how we met? I was shocked to hear your voice as it was inversely proportional to your body and also the surname 'Kulkarni' attracted me😜.
While making jokes on me , you  always had my back to stab it. You are that irritating person in life who keeps calling me on the day before the exam saying" I have done my third revision. what about you?" while I am still on the second lesson figuring out what to do and what not to.
You have a habit of creating non veg joke on any situation in life...And sometimes it had help help the group to memorise some study materials ..Which makes you "Nonveg Queen " of the group.Our common love towards "F.R.I.E.N.D.S" and "THE BIG BANG THEORY" and Nanda Pradhan , Hari tatya and legendary Marathi movies and dialogues like " Niranjan babancha prasad" is annoying for other members of the group but we still go on in the same discussion without caring much about it!.
        Dude, you are the reason why I started watching English movies and getting better at knowing celebs. You remember we took a class of film appreciation? It was a feast for me to watch movies with you where we mostly used to eat Wheelos and chat about the story , actors  and much more.
        You are a gem of a person. you can mix with any kind of group out there and make your own impression.Lucky to have you as my sister / friend. I would say stay in touch but you would make another non veg joke out of it.
So , all the best!
