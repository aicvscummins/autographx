Hey Shweta!
I really like your outgoing personality. 
You are one of few people from former B4 who has mingled so well with all the class.
No wonder you are somewhat face of many whi shy away from talking.
Always on first bench and ready to ask and ans questions.
It was good to have you in class.
Keep in touch and all the best for you future!
