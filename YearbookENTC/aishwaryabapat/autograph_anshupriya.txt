Hey Aishwarya,
Though we have known each other from the first year, our friendship mainly blossomed when we came together as a B1 batch and I am really happy that it happened. One thing I have always observed about you,  is how humble, supporting and a good listener you are. Even talking to you for the first time felt as if we were friends for years. You are very down to earth and a sweet person. I really appreciate your qualities as a person and as a friend. Just be the same. 
Love you 
Anshu.
