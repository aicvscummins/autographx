Aishuuuu, i always called you aishu since the first year. You were my first friend in college. I still remember we meeting on the stairs of mechanical building,  till today, it has been a great journey with you.
Thaaaanks for always saying yes to fried idli, and also for explaining me 2 Page ka lambaa sum even on the phone call on exam day without getting mad for all the  stupid questions I asked.
I still remember you literally sent me around 70 photos in line of your own handwritten placement notes that too in order, that tells how helpful you are towards your friends. You working so hard without giving up for placements was unbelievable.
Thanks aishuu. thank you for everything.
