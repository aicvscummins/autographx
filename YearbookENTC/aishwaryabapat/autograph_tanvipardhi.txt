Hey Aishwarya!


I’ll always remember you as my first friend in Cummins. I don’t know how but we became good friends. I could survive the first few days of college only because of you, Thanks dude!. You introduced me to the world of Game of Thrones, you kept on telling me how good Jon Snow is. But sorry i ended up falling for Jamie instead (i know it’s weird)🙈
You are an amazing person. All the best for your future! Be in touch :)
