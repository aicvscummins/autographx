Hey Aishwarya,
                         I remember your lazy face every morning...like it's a compulsion on you to come to the college and attend lectures...You are one of the members who are always ready to bunk...Happy to have you as a colleague.Looking forward to make more memories with you.
I won't say stay in touch cause we are gonna work together (from next year😛)
