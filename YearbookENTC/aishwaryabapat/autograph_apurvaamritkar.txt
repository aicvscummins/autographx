Hey Aishwarya, 
I think you were the first familiar face that I came across on my first day in college which definitely comforted me as I was pretty darn nervous.I love how our bond has gotten stronger over the years and that I can tell you absolutely anything knowing you wouldn't judge me for it. I'll always remember our silly converations and us gossiping during our classes and labs haha. I think that you are an amazing and kind human and you deserve the best. 
Love ya!
