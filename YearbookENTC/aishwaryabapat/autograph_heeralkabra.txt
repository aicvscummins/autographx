Dearest Aishwarya,


Technically we have known each other since the eighth grade, but life as we know it, right?
Nvm, I think we have and we will cover up for the time lost in the coming years!! 
You my beauty with brains, are going to go a really long way cuz you deserve every bit of it!
I have learnt so much from you as a person, but most of all the way you handle each and every emotion, with so much grace and sarcasm, I am a fan bro! I’m going to come over for tutorials every now and then, okay? 
I’m just too happy and too lucky to have found a lifetime friend like you :’) 


Abhi ke liye itna hi, 
Love you always!
