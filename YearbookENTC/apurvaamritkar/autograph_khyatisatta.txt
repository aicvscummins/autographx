Hey Apurv,
We didn't get a chance to talk a lot but some about going for MS and random shiz.
I hope that you get into amazing universities and we get to meet there.
PS: Your 'Back to December' rendition back in first year was awesome <3
Hope you have a great life ahead!
Stay amazing <3.
Cheers and stay in touch!
