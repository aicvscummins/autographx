Hey Apurva, we know each other for almost 6 years, can you believe that!! I still remember our study sessions during our 11th and 12th, where we only use to talk about future. We had some amazing times together and pretty informative ones too hahaha. I will definitely catch up with you when you go to US. Have amazing life head.
Loads of love , Shivani Patil
