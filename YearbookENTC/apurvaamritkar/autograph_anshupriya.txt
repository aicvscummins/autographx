Hey Apurva,
I still remember our first college interaction and I could have never imagined the transition in our friendship would be so amazing. You are for sure the best Practical and study partner this college has given me.  Plus you are an amazing friend yaar, I will definitely miss you. I just wish this corona thing vanishes asap and you get to join your dream college in your all-time favorite country (hahaha) . I hope the best for you and keep in contact always (bhool mat jaana mughe :D)
Love You,
Anshu Priya
