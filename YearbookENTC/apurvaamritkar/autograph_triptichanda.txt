Hey Apurva!
I couldn't have asked for a better friend and a companion for these four years. I can not wait for everyone else in the wold to see how amazing you are and be in awe of you. You are just a ball of awesomeness waiting to burst. I know that with you I have found a friend for life and I will never forget you. Forever in my heart.
