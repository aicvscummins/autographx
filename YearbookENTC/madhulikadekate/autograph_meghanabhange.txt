Hey, 


It was one of the best things to know you. Us talking about random things throughout the night, hiding from wardens. I really miss talking to you and don’t know what went down between us, but I am really sure 5 years down the line I will think it was silly and remember all the amazing times we’ve spent together. You’re a really fun person to be around <3


I hope we can be friends through this new phase in our lives
