Hey Madhulika!
U are such an innocent and pure soul! And a strong girl! Despite teachers and mentors troubling u ,u were strong! I still remember the saddest day when faculties werent accepting ur submissions even if u had provided a medical certificate and u were crying really bad! I felt so sorry and guilty for not consoling u properly that time! But i only kept saying dont worry they will ultimately take ! Pls dont cry again for ppl who dont value u!
Madhu, u carry happiness wherever u go!  >3 Stay the way u are and thank you so very much for helping me, guiding me in my difficult times!
Wish u very best for ur future ! Stay smiling and stay connected!


With love,
Anushree.
