Hey mau! 
We became friends really late in college but I'm so glad we did! I'm going to miss you so much, you have the most beautiful smile! I'm going to miss all our bitching sessions and overthinking what will happen in life! I don't think we'll ever forget making sapna's mermaid costume either :p
You're a great friend, you're difficult to read bit you have such a beautiful heart. I love you so much and I'm going to miss you but I'm glad we'll always have each other! All the best ❤️
