Hey Akshata,
U are an extremely strong and hardworking girl! I still remember that day when we sat in canteen and how i was sharing my desire to have stayed in hostel atleast once in my engineering years! U really appreciated that but alongwith it u shared ur struggles while staying away from ur loved ones for the first time and how difficult it was for u initially ….but u stayed strong and didnt give up!:) 
Apart from these i remember all our random conversations we had whenever we met! U always checked up on me and said good wishes for me. It really means a lot! See you very soon! Stay safe and wish u all the success in life>3


With love,
Anushree
