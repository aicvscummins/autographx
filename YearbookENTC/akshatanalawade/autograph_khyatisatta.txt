Akshata!!
The one thing I like the most about you that you speak your mind
I can't help but laugh at all the times we would pretend that we were gonna study in the discussion room but ended up talking about irrelevant stuff :D
The dinner at Abhishek was amazing and we should have done it more. I wish we do it more now.
PS: I'm still waiting for an invitation to go to the Jatra <3
Love <3.
Cheers and stay in touch!
