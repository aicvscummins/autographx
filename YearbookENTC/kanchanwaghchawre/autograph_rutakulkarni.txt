Kanchan...
The most level headed of us all(though you are tied with Shruti for that title). You have always been an "adarsh" kid to everyone else around you but boy, how wonderfully you act! I remember thinking of you as an innocent bacha when we were in the first year and then I remember our convos that burst that image of you.
We have bonded on many things but the important ones being books, mafia, Marvel, no knowledge about Bollywood and pets! Our convos are mostly on what we dreamt the last night, our Pinterest shares, something going in some remote corner of the world and random things. We went to our first ever quiz competition in our first year, we had 2 quizes that day and I remember the GK one, we literally screwed up every question by overthinking and left before they even announced the results.
But then 2 years later we won in the GK quiz even though it had Bollywood questions!!
We also had an entire day at MOOD INDIGO where it was just us two and we had so much fun! Except for that one incident with that crazy dude...uggghhh! Remember, I was explaining about the sub systems in the KTM bike when a customer asked us for information leaflets...? We also did quite a lot of shopping that day.
And before our last semester when we had night out at Tanvi's place, when we were en route to her place...we had a pretty funny incident...we were laughing so bad afterwards and so were the other party involved. 
We always had notes ready before exams...while yours were rather succinct than my 200 pages ka notes! We have had so many great memories, bro! I can't really pen those all in this file, so you will have to do with what I could write...I can talk about those memories if you want... ;)
To all the great years ahead and to our friendship....
Lots of love,
Ruta
