Hey Kanchan! You are the best CR our class had. You are so dedicated towards your goals and stand for what according to you is right. Thatâ€™s an amazing quality, I hope you never change. I still remember our first-year elections for CR, you told everyone that your dad is a police officer which made oh so tensed air a bit light. Like that we have many memories being in same batch for 4 years. I wish you have all the success in life and that we catch up in future.
loads of love, Shivani Patil
