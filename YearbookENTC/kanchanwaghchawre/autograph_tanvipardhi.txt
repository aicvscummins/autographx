Hey Kanchan,

Dude!  This is the most difficult one to write coz, I don't know how to put up in words everything that I feel! We have come a long way from total strangers to bestiesğŸ˜˜ From first year itself, you have dragged into everything be it deco room or volunteering, but we have always ended up having fun. Our bond just grew stronger day by day. Cheers to the bunks, endless talks and the countless memories that we've made!! Love you the mostğŸ’–ğŸ’–ğŸ’–
