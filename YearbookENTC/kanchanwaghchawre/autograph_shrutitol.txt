Deer Kanchan,
                       You might think that the spelling is wrong but it is written on purpose.There was a deer named Kanchanmriga in Ramayana who was very beautiful, attraction point but not easy to catch.You are similar to that one.
Yes baby you don't know you are beautiful and that's what makes you beautiful (credits: One direction). 
                       Kanchan , I couldn't imagine how a daughter of police inspector and a class CR is one of the closer friend of mine (yes I had your first impression pretty wrong ). Seriously we can talk for  hours and hours about sweet and the sour and how your family is doing okay( credits: Ed Sheeran). 
                       I still have no words to say anything but I love you...And I will say Stay in touch otherwise I will kick you!
