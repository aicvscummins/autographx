Hey Kanchan!
I love all ur books collection!Thanks for being the advisor whenever i asked u which is a good book to read!(*although i never took out time to read! ).I love reading books too but somehow i had lost touch with my beloved hobby and having you around made me feel blessed ! just to see all ur collections and to listen you telling about what u were reading that time! 
Apart from that u have a cool vibe which makes people want to talk with u or simply have great conversation with you!Also you are extremely organised in whatever u do ..be it maintaining class notes or planning any event!
I have always seen u smiling  and being happy all the time! Stay the way you are and wishing u lots and lots of success ahead! Please stay in touch and hope to meet u again someday:)


With love,
Anushree.
