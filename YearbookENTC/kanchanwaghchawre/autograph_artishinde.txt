Heyy kanchan! 
You are one of the best college friends I have. 
What to say about you...You are the ideal person anyone can ever be.
I remember spending ample time with you in lectures, labs, our canteen talks  and during orals your notes were saviour🙈. 
I troubled you many times for notes and doubts but you have always helped me without getting irritated. All these small things account for amazing memories which I would treasure for lifetime.
You are really very sincere, dedicated and hardworking person.Just be the same.
Wish you all the best for your future..and take a word from me..one day I will get to hear the news of you cracking UPSC exam.
Don't forget me and always be in touch.😍


With lots of love
