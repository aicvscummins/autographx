Hey Kanchan,
It's been a treat knowing you these 4 years. You've always been everyone's go-to person in our batch. Whether it was for lab readings, tut answers or any doubt, it was you we counted on. You're a very amiable and patient person. I’m glad we were in the same batch. Exams were a bit easier to give knowing you’re around. You are a perfect mixture of fun yet serious. Stay in touch! All the best for everything!
