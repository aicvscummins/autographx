Hey dukkar,
You are one of the most unique person I have ever came across. Too slow in everything, but does everything with perfection and that's the thing I like about you. I used to love when you used to call out my name (mau). I miss you. Hostel even I'm not gonna say anything because they are never ending memories. I am not going to do your tariff anymore because you didn't do mine!! Hehe.. but I am really glad we became friends and we'll be friends forever. I love you. <3 

Yours one and only, 
Mau
