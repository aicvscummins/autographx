Unnati,
One of the first few friends I made in college, the absolute fun loving ,vibrant girl and also a graceful dancer.
Exams and labs were fun with u,and our Auto Rides ...you always had to sit on my lap xP.
I was waiting for ur Fashion Show look...but covid had other plans.
It was great to know you.
Stay same.Hope u get all happiness and success in life.
Take Care!! 

With  Love,
Anvesha
