Hey Unnu!!
I had so much fun with you being in the same batch in FY. I still remember going to gym together, those dance sessions were amazing!! Wish we could've spent more time together.
I'll miss being called Teja!
Stay happy, keep dancing and all the best <3
(ps- I'm still jealous of your perfect shape)
