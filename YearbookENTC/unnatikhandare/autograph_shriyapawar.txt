Hey unnati!!
I'm going to miss you so much, we became friends in the hostel and I'm going to miss studying with you, I'm going to miss seeing you randomly scribbling on paper and calling it your "notes". I'm going to miss randomly getting drunk and talking about our lives. I love you, let's always be in touch.
All the best for everything!
