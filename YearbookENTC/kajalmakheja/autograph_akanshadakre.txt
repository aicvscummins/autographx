Hi Kajal,
Thank you very much yaar ❤❤…. I don’t know how I would have survived without u these 4 years yaar……...You were always there with me when I needed you and thanks by the way for carefully listening my silly talks about people, bearing my mood swings and I remember how I used to message you and disturb u at night by asking  ”soo gyi kya” it was very funny. I enjoyed watching random movies while studying nd eating that veg biryani which was made by you which was very tasty. And by the way I don’t know whether I said to you this or not that “You teach very well yaar, you should be a teacher not engineer”.
I am always there for you just call me whenever you need me. Don’t worry about what others think or say to you, just ignore them and focus on your goals and stay positive. I will miss u yaar a lot…❤❤❤….Be in touch with me  and I will be disturbing u always.
All d best for your future!!
Love U
Akansha
