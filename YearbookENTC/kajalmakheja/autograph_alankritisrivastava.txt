Hey! I remember us meeting during admissions for the first time. It has been amazing knowing you. We used to hang out a lot earlier and it’s just sad that we stopped later..I’m sorry for that though. We used to randomly go for walks and paani puri..you’ve unknowingly been there for me a lot of times. I will always remember you sitting with me when I wasn’t get a job. That conversation I had with you really lifted me up. You’ve grown tremendously as a person. From a shy timid girl to a confident independent lady, you have made some serious progress. Stay in touch! All the best for everything!
