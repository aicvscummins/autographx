Hi Kajal!!!
I clearly remember we came in contact during EDL Lab, we were grouped together and till date we are always in one group.We shared so many memories (projects, studying, Internship,assignments, hostel and so on) we stood in peaks and thoughts of our journey, I got to know more about your likes and dislikes and vegetables 🥦🍆that you have never tasted. Internship turned out fun because of you( I still have that book with me) 
I remember you saying " Jab Tak roungi nahi tab Tak nahi milega" but in Fact it's your hard work that paid you off.
Remember to Stay Positive and Healthy
And most importantly palan sir's saying "Subha Subha doodh me ghee milake pine se sehat acchi reheti hai"
Love you ❤️ Always be in touch 😘
