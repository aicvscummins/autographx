Kajal!! you were always one roll number before me and helped through so many exams. I'm so sure I owe half my pointer to you. We have had so many great conversations about so many things. I'm glad you trusted me enough to open up to me. I'll always remember you as the most hardworking girl who broke all barriers over 4 years and emerged in flying colours. Stay in touch and keep well <3
