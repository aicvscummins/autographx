Kajal!!!
You are an amazing person in and out who I'm so glad that I got to know!
Going for a movie in the middle of an exam was so out of character for you, but you have grown up into such an individual woman who has overcome her fears and barriers!!
Thanks for being a part of my journey!!
Stay amazing <3.
Cheers and stay in touch!
