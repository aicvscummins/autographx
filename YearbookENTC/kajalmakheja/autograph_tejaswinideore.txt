Hey Makkhi,
No matter how many fights we had, we were always together at the end of it.
I know you'll miss yelling at me and scolding me as much as I'll miss irritating you and doing stupid stuff around you. You were always there like a mother who takes care of her stubborn child and I love you so much even I don't say it often.
Thanks for teaching us before exam,  for making us study (Jabardasti). I'll be there for you always and miss me<3 
May you have a beautiful journey ahead.
