Hi Shruti! Having our roll numbers around each other all these years has been a pleasure. I still remember it was you who took the initiative to make a ENTC B class group. You’re a very jolly and fun person to be around. You’ve made boring lab/tutorials more fun and difficult exams a lot easier. Thank you for being a part of my graduation journey. Stay in touch! All the best for everything the future holds!
