Hey Shruti!
I have loved all ur poetry and writing work in marathi! It feels soothing to hear u speak in clear marathi ! Also u have amazing voice! Keep singing! Keep smiling! Ur drawing skills are amazing too! And i shall not forget to mention Robocon! U were consistent and dedicated with ur choices and stayed with it till the end! U managed everything pretty well and u should be proud of that! U recently became my library book exchange partner! I wish i had found u before we would have done so well! haha:) U have a really sweet voice and have really helped me many times! I wish u all the success in life! Stay in touch and take care>3
