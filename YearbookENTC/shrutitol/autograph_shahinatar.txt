Hello TOL,
        We were lab partners in EDC. Remember how we used to split work (keyboard and mouse). You named me Sine annoying but still a very special name for me ( I know you are waiting for my COSINE). When I came to the hostel, I saw a totally different side of yours (caring and lazy as well). I am very proud of u meri TATA MOTORS KI ENGINEER. TATA is very close to my house and we are going to catch up soon. ILY.
