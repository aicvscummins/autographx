Shruti!!
You've been so great these 4 years, right from being in the same group in BEEE lab to being in B3 writing tutorials and attending labs. You are really funny, smart and hardworking, I'm going to miss you! Thank you for everything, also please keep writing, you're amazing at it! 
All the best <3
