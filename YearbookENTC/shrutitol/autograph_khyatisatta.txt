Shruti!!
We've had the most random conversations at 8 in the morning in the MC LAb.
Honestly? That's how I felt awake.
Whenever I talk to you I can't help but feel awestruck by your immense, massive Marathi vocabulary
I hope you have a great journey ahead.
Stay in touch and invite me to Wai <3
PS: Green tea does taste nice
