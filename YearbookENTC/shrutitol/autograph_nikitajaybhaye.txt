Hey Shruti,
Right from first year's hostel life to final year's localite life,you were always there for me.Our hostel fun,studies,every single moments are close to my heart.You coming to my hostel or vice versa at anytime were too much fun.You are one of my best friend.Because of you,all these year were amazing.And yes,we will be in touch with each other always bro.
i wish you all the success and happiness.
Lots of love
Yours Niki
