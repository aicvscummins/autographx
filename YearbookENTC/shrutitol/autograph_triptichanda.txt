Hey Shruti!
Did I ever tell you that you and my sister share names? I think the time that we spent together the most and which was the best has to be Robocon.
The bonds that are made there in the arena last forver. Eventhough we did not hang out much before and after that I knew that when push came to shove you would have my back like I would have yours.
It has been great knowing you and I hope that you will keep in touch.
All the best!
