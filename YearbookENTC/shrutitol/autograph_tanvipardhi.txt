Hey Storyteller!

You have a superpower of teleporting someone with you to the imaginary world through your stories. It feels like we know the characters, like they are our best friends, we can feel their pain, get excited for them and always wish for their happy future... just like our friendship... YOU and ME. 

We have been friends since first year. We might got introduced through env grp project (Yellowüíõ), but sticking by each other ever since then was by choiceüíñ (eventhough I don't like vadapav and misal). With time, our bond got stronger and tighter. Dude you have provided us shelter in need, your hostel was our second home indeed. We get lucky when teamed together... luckily passed mini-project by doing absolutely nothing, luckiy we suceeded in tricking our mentor with Btech project progress and completion, and we got luckiest while playing Beg,Borrow,Click at PVG! Remeber?? That is the reason why you get unlucky during practical exams, coz we aren't a team there :(

You are multitalented. Writer, singer, chef, poetess, dancer, memer, editor and so much more... Moreover, you ace each of these skills!! How is it even possible?? Maybe, coz you do SURYA namaskar daily. Is there anything which you cannot do?? Yes, you cannot say 'yes' to your crush even when they themselves are more interested in you!! 

From mini project to B.tech project... From PVG to IIT Bombay... From sharing notes to sharing memes... From F.R.I.E.N.D.S to Big Bang Theory... From Sinhagad to Satara to Mumbai... From formal Hi-Hello to writing heartfelt letters...  We've done it all... From surya to chandra... he fakta tuch kela :p

You have always been my go-to person. You know how to comfort people with words and warm hugs. I'm not bidding you a farewell any time soon, we've a long way to go even if distance aparts us. Love you‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
PS: I love you more coz you share your cheese and paneer with me... when we meet next, let's have "toh ani ti"
