Hey Pradnya!
Honestly, I was a bit intimidated by you in the class elections.
I still remember our teachers announcing the result- I won by just 1 vote and I'll chalk it up to luck.
I could never have handled being in your place with the stride that you managed.
There is much more to you than me- the sports aspect which I never ventured into and the internship in Taiwan!
I have a feeling that you have much bigger things in life waiting for you to go get it.
So I wish you all the luck for your future and may there be lots of success.
