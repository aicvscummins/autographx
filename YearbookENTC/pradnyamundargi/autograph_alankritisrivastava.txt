Praduuuu my love! Where would you like me to start from? The 3rd std. friendship which was purely for your dabba? Or the 1st year friendship in which your dabba still played an important role?
Food apart, I couldn’t have asked for a better friend to smack me when I’m being..well when I’m just being me, or when I have to go somewhere and I need to look the best. I don’t even know what brought us so close together. Maybe it was those common room singing sessions? Or was it you and Shriya pole dancing on the gym machine in the common room? Wait..I think it was Mood Indigo. That trip came with its own level of shit, but it’s what got us here. I couldn’t have imagined passing exams if it wasn’t for you screaming at me to reach the reading hall on time. Do you remember going on all around the city on your almost dying Scooty pept? I remember being so shit scared of it, but well you were always so ‘Dhoom Machale’ on it. I can never foregt our McD study dates and going for random movies. You’re the one person who has kept me in check always. Whether it was for me eating junk, or me teasing you about you know what, you have always been there. I hate how you recorded me at the weirdest times,but that was a part of the package deal I suppose.
You’ve been my constant for 4 years. And I always promise to be there to tease you and gossip with you. I love you Pradzzz!
