I have this memory of us shortlisting dresses in your house and then going to eat at central because we were craving KFC. 
Since the first day I met you in college I thought you were the coolest (no kidding)


Here we are years later and a million mistakes older. All those times fooling Dube and then freaking out about meeting Rajesh. Talking about all the things we did (didn’t do) in the project and then eating in Subway at KLN. 


I will miss you, pretty sure you’re bound for great things--please stay in touch :)
