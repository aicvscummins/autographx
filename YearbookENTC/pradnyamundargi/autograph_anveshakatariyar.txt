The very first memory of yours is the "chirpy girl" coz u kept on talking for the sanstha visit....Then we were put in the same batch which gave me a chance to know u better.You were always supportive for bunks and the last minute prep for viva was real fun.Stay same.Hope u get all happiness and success in life.Stay in Touch. 
With  Love,
Anvesha
