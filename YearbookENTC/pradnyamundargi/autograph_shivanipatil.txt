6-year Wow, I had my best college time you. I will never forget our randomly going for movies to our Manali trip. We had amazing time together. You an amazing and very caring person. I also will never forget your cat (internally I wish I had got to know her better hahaha). Stay the same and I hope we will catch up later in US. All the best for your future.
Loads of Love, Shiavni Patil
