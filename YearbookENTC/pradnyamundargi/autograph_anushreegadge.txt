Hey Pradnya!
U are really a great sportsperson! I still remember the gandhaar night when we had our faculty performance, we all had soo much fun together! And how can i forget the few singing sessions we had together! I will cherish these happy times forever! I Love how you stand up for animal rights and try and make an impact while there are soo many out there who know that theres so much wrong going around and dont really do anything to better it!
Stay the way u are! And I hope u get all the success in life that u deserve!Cheers!


With love,
Anushree:)
