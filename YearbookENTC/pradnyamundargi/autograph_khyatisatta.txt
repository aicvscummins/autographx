***Cries dramatically***
I love you so much Pradu. <3 <3
From being the supposedly hoity-toity person to the only person in my life who I can unabashedly say anything to, we've definitely come a long way.
You know things about me, that I was scared to admit, embaressed to tell and what not.
You just understand my emotions better than me most of the times. Before I can admit to feeling any of it.
Half of it doesn't even make sense.But you still stick around being the most supportive person ever.
I'm sad college life is ending, but we've got another year here which we'll make the most of!!!
Love you <3
