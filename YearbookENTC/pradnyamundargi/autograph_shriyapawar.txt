We've gone from being friends in school and making up stupid plays and then meeting in college being the best of friends, having our fights and going back to being really good friends. Our friendship has literally been a sine wave😂 but let's stop with that now. I'm always going to remember us exchanging clothes cause we're bored, stuffing our faces with Chinese food and roaming the streets of bohri ali for the fashion show. You're incredible, thank you for everything! All the best ❤️
