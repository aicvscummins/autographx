Hi Pradnya!!
Man, I’m going to miss our labs where we spent most of the time talking about random things. And thank you so much for my first kitten! I had great fun with you! We talked on a variety of topics instead of working on lab practicals, we did so many jugaads , we also had some great ideas bounce between us. I remember those sessions that Kamble ma'am made us attend and how we goofed instead of listening to what was happening(remember the sweeee….?). I’m so glad that we got to know each other in the past 4 years. Let's keep in touch!
