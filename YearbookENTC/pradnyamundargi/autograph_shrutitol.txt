Hey Pradnya,
                     I always wondered how you balanced sports with your studies.I also remember how we used to play a stupid game to name a new movie starting from end letter of the prior one in the Robotics lecture. I admire your love towards cats .I also remember you taking lead in making a singing group for first year competition even though you were not a part of it!
Stay in touch. All the best.
