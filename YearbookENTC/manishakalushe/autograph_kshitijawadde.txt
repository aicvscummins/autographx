Dear Manisha,
   You were my first lab partner in chemistry and physics lab. I still remember how we used to complete writeups one minute before, how we used to match our calculated values to the correct one by some juggad. 
May God always bless you!! 
All the very best for your future!!
Stay in touch…


Love,
Kshitija:)
