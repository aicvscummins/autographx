Hey Manisha,
I like your helping nature towards friends u always used to say that friends come first and then the studies.I remember the first day when we met in hostel Ur di came in my room and she told me that you are from this this place and be her friend. It was from that day we became friends.
 I enjoyed watching movies with you .It was very interesting to listen to suspense novel stories from you as used to tell stories with all expressions which I liked the most.

The song 'Tujhe kitna Chahne Lage hai’ which u sang and sent me, i literally can't forget that song. I dont know whether i told u this or not but it really touched my heart yaar…. ❤❤  though it was not so good.
Do you remember how we used to talk continuously randomly on any topics at night and how we used to behave….when hostel food was not so good? I will miss those talks and stories a lot in future. 


Thanks yaar ❤❤…for always being there with me to help for things be it like I want to go to doctor Or when I am stuck in any problem related to my life or any silly thing. I always used to come to you for help and you were always there for me.
I will miss u yaar a lot…❤❤❤….Be in touch with me always….
All the best for your future!!

Love U ❤❤
Akansha
