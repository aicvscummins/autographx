Hi platypus Meghana,
I know you stay mentally out of this world but sometimes I feel you've gone physically out of the world too :p
Thank you for lending me your bike all the time. I think we bonded over gossipping in SY and I remember you making me coffee at 2am(so that we can gossip more after coffee xD)
Thank you for unknowingly playing a cupid (NVM :p)
Oh I also can't forget how you used to bribe me with food to get gossip and how we finished your dabba from the tiffin services.
I can't believe you let me have prawn noodles!!! (WHYYY? :3)
It kinda amazes me how you're always ready for a smoke xD Hope to see you in Bangalore.
Lots of love <3
