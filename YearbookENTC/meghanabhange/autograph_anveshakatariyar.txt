Meghana,
We were in the same batch for the first year..I remember we gelled really when in 
FPL lab..Also we shared a common interest for coding.I remember you were never bound with what's there in the portion you always wanted to try real life applications...And that enthusiasm is rarely seen. Hope you get all the success in life.

With Love,
Anvesha
