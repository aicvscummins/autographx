Hey, 
I'm grateful that you were with me in time when I was alone. You helped me and taught me things. There might be some misunderstandings between us, but now when I'm home I do miss your singing in the room, making fun of Ruchi, playing with the cat, all the gossips. We might not be so close, but even you were a part of my life and we did have a good time. You are a good friend. Thank you!!
