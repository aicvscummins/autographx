Meghana Bhange, we have had 20% of our conversations verbally and 80% telepathically! Over the past 4 years you went from being the girl who didn't attend morning lectures, to not attending morning and afternoon lectures, to not attending lectures at all. I can't believe we pulled through this entire final year project with last minute report writing, printing and plagiarism checks. We even created alternative biology, converted the jugular vein into a nerve and stuck with those theories as if they were facts in front of profs. You are the one person I know who is as crazy about cats as I am. So keep in touch fur-ever! <3
