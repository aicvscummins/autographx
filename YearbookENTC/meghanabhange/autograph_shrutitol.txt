Hey Meghana,
                       I didn't know you much in the first year but got to know you better in starting days of ROBOCON. I was shocked to see your understanding and application of Electronics and coding. Also , you have done a great job through AICVS. You are a simple , down to earth , less attendance and Maau Spammer girl.There is no doubt that you have a brighter future. All the best. Stay in touch.
