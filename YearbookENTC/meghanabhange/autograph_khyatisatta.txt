Meghana!!!!
I can't even remember when we first met or spoke.
The most interesting first memory I can recall is how one day you randomly said Abhiraj and you just wanna be friends and.....
the next walked in the class like 15 mins late(Typical you), and said how both of ya'll got together over a phone call.
You were one of my first friends in the class when I didn't know anybody.
You made me help tolerate engineering a little more through your enthusiasm.
Just be you and count me in for any conspiracy theories you have.
I heart you so much!!
