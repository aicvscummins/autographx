Hey Meghana!
U are an amazingly talented person! I love how easily u convert ur ideas into actual product and that u always have a solution to a problem! I have always admired the passion u have towards all ur projects and technology in general!And how u are always ready to make something new and different! 
 I still remember going to “Hinge” sessions every sat and sun in SY and how interesting they were(*Which i had registered bcoz u insisted me and i m glad i did coz i had the best time on weekends doing something productive there!) I really enjoyed working with u for our Ty miniproject! I couldnt contribute much haha but u worked on it day and night and finally had it ready on the day we had to present.I wish i could have taken more interest in the project and helped u even a bit hehe. But anyways u have always been extremely kind and understanding of ppl around you and u have guided me many times when i wasnt able to make simple decisions LOL! I love how sorted u are with ur daily routine and that u know clearly what u want to do in future! Wishing u loads of success in life! Hope to meet again , stay in touch and take care:)


With love,
Anushree
