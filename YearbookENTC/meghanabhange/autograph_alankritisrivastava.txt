Bhange! I can’t believe we’ve known each other for 6 years now. I loved our random bonding sessions after months of not talking much. I’m going to miss your weird ass jokes and amazing fashion sense. Do you remember our bitching sessions about mutual people from the past.I hope we stay in touch even after this and have a lot more emotional moments when we aren’t in our complete senses.Let's always stay in touch ❤️❤️
