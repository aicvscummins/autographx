Bhange! Thank you for riding at 20kmph and taking that one hour ride with me to find big bazaar 😂. That was the foundation of our friendship ❤️ We've done so much stuff together and had so much fun that'll it actually makes me thank Cummins. I'm going to miss cooking at your house, laughing for hours at "carrot cake", driving around talking about life, handling each other drunk and coming up with weird conspiracy theories against the warden when high. I love you bhange bhange, let's make more memories in Bangalore. All the best ❤️
