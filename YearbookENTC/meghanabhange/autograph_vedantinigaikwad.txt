Hey Bhange,
You were the best roommate. I really missed you when you decided to change rooms. I love how quickly we bonded and how we shared everything with each other. You are creative and smart and just so awesome. The Bits Goa trip was so cooooolll. I love you a lot and let's just friends again because I miss you. 


Love,
Veda
