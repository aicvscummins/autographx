Suri,
Kya  hi kahu be. You were my partner in crime. Kaise bhaagte the hum guest lectures se😂😂. Ek tu hi hai jo mere saath saare faltu jokes enjoy karti hai. You have put up with so much of my bullshit(well, thats because of your immense love for me😂😂😂.)This aint a good-bye Suri, abhi to tere life me complications karna baaki hai. Aate rehna Ayushi ke saath,aur mere ghar aajana pune me aate hi!! My favourite memory of ours is the last morning in udaipur, jab hum khidki ke bahar baithke gaane sunn rhe the. Lets not forget the binge-watching session we had. You have been supportive throughout. I couldn't have asked for a better friend. I love you kutti.❤️❤️
Also tujhe "G mane Genius use karna chahiye tha tatti aurat😂😂😂
