Hey Nikita! I had such a wonderful time with you in all our lab sessions in second year and our Mini Project in third year. Dube is still my mentor for my Final year project and every time I look at his face I realize he doesn't have eyebrows (thanks to you). I remember we were stnading in front of him in the project lab and trying not to laugh. It was wonderful knowing you. Thank you for everything. Keep in touch and good luck for the future <3
