Hey Nikita,
The way you study just before the exams and still manage to score so well is admirable.
I have always had a lot of fun with you.
I will always miss the funny banter we had at the bus stop and during labs.
Thank you for everything.
I wish you all the success and happiness in life
love you
Stay in touch
