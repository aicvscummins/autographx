Nikita!!!
Can't tell you how glad I'm that we got talking in second year(Should have in first year itself)
Anyway, you are one of the few people I know with the wittiest sense of humour I've ever met.
Thanks for all the times I hadn't studied shit and knowing you were sitting beside me just seemed to relieve me immediately
Stay amazing <3.
Love <3
Cheers and stay in touch!
