Heyy  Nikita!


You are the most chill person on this planet and at the same time hardworking too. I remember the time we spend at Twintech on our project and the way you get annoyed at shounak sir was an entertaining treat for me.
Sometimes you have also annoyed me by not picking up calls but nevermind I know you are very good person at heart and always stay in touch.
Wish you all the best for your future.


With lots of love
