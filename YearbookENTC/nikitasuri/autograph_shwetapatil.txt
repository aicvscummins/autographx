Hey Nikita!
Tatti insaanðŸ˜‚..abbe bada miss karungi tere ko yaar...I remember the 1st day of college and you saying that you come all the way from wagholi..Tu humare gaaliyon keliye responsible haiðŸ˜‚..you are majorly responsible for all the pranks we did..i still remember doing prank calls to your friend ðŸ˜‚..I remember how we used to go together on my bike everyday...i had my first fall from my bike with you broðŸ˜‚..I know we had our own ups and downs but who cares we still stick to each other..I cannot ask for a better roommate..You were like my mom the whole time..You are such a caring person...remember the times we hated mess ka khana and always ate junk food...Ugghh! just so many memories...
You are real talented and hardworking person..Acha chal jaldi se pune aaja..tereko ko ek baar gale lagana hai..apne parties baki hai..aur haan Banglore mein bhi aise hi apna naam roshan kariyoðŸ˜‚..Ayushi ke saath milne aa jana..(woh nahi ayegi toh tu aa janaðŸ˜‚)..Aur chal chal  abhi se shopping pe lag apne ko Bali jana hai..( achhe kapde toh chahiye hi)..
Love you suriiii..
Tatti insaan again ðŸ˜‚
