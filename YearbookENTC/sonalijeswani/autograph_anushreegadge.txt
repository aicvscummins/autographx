Hey Sonali!
U are an extremely intelligent and talented girl! I will miss all the times we spent together and yes our lunchtime discussions! Not to forget how u have brought Dal Pakwan for everyone many times! It used to make our day! Thank you soo much for giving me notes whenever i needed and btw teri handwriting itni bhi buri nahi hai! I can still read hehe. I will miss our trips together to movies and malls and dominos and what not! Please stay in touch and all the very best for ur future! I m sure u will achieve all ur gaols in life>3
Stay in touch and wear more kurtis! U look absolutely gorgeous in them!


With love,
Anushree:)
