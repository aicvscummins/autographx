Sonaliii, hamari topper. Since the second year when the roll numbers got shuffled according to the surname, we were always 24 and 25. We literally have given every viva of engineering together and every exam with you infront of me. It was unbelievable , how hard you used to work and how much dedication you had. I still remember there won't be a single exam in these 3 years in which you didn't calmly prayed before starting writing. Itni mehnati hai tu, aur itni smart bhi, basss bohottt jyada tension leti hai? I remember we were lab partners for EDC. We were surely a good pair and we enjoyed it so much. You're sweet person to know. All the best to you, I'll always remember you as my forever exam partner of engineering 😄.
Take care. And all the best
