Sonali,
I still remember the day I called your name loudly, and you gave me a look and moved on xP.
Then we mingled-up while collecting our library cards and the rest is history.
You're one of the constants, best best friend I have made in college.

You amazed me by your crystal-clear Concepts of Quantum Physics which just went above my head ;). 
I remember the best part of the day was when we sat and discussed every minute details of all the unimportant things....And the dealing with ur and vinaya's obsession for Tarot cards and Horoscope xP.
You are a gem which I never wanna loose.


It was great to know you .
Stay same.Hope u get all happiness and success in life.
Take Care!! 

With  Love,
Anvesha
