Hey Sonali,
You are very generous to help others in studies may it be doubt or anything else which I admire the most. I can’t forget that cockroach incident in Alibagh and that curry-rice which your mother gave for me specially it was very yummy thank you so much for that. I recall how I used to disturb u a lot in internship why I don’t know that thanks for bearing that. I enjoyed ur company in project and college how we use to talk about psychology behavior of humans. Thanks for sharing with me your tiffin in internship, helping me in clearing my doubts and all the memories which we had. At last I will say that be always happy ‘Meri photo mat khichna tum sab log’. Hope to see you again and go for a trip. By the way teri party pending hai……………
Stay in touch!!
All the best for your future!! ❤❤
