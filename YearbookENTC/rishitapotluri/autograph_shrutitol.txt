Hey Rishita,
                   We didn't have regular interaction but it was fun everytime we talked to each other. I didn't know that the girl who is shy in the communications class is so much talkative .Do you remember once we both bunked a class when we couldn't see our group members in the class? Also I can not forget our useless discussion on golden hen story and you taught me a word " Bangar Guddu"and it now became my petname for you.
All the best . Stay in touch.
