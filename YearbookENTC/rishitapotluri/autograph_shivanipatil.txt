Hey Rishita! B3 batch is nothing without you, without your motivation and chal aaj bunk karte hai I would be devastated. I will always remember you as extremely jolly person. You have a gift to make friends with whomever you talk to. Stay the same and I hope to catch up with you after college. All the best for your future.
PS I had fun making fun of our exes.
Loads of Love, Shiavni Patil
