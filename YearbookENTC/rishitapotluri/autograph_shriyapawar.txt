Hey rishita! 
I wish we'd become friends sooner! You're such a fun person to hang out and you listen so patiently to others when they need you. You always cheer up everyone around you! I couldn't have gotten a better viva partner! Our vivas were epic, we only laughed with teachers and came out. I'm going to miss asking you ki kitne units padhe before every exam. Thank you yaar. Always stay in touch ❤️ 
All the best you're going to be amazing!
