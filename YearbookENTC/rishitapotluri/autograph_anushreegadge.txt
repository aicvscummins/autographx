Hey Rishita!
U are an extremely kind individual! I love how u were always bubbly around in our class and yes i will surely miss all ur jokes u used to crack in lunch breaks!U live every bit of your life to the fullest!
 We have not talked much but whenever we did u were very polite with me! I will miss all the masti u did during innovation in Ty ! U might not know this but u are a complete mood booster! Even if someone hasnt talked with u ..just being around u they will come to know how welcoming u are and how easily u can make friends!
Wishing u lots and lots of success in life! Stay the way u are:)


With love,
Anushree:)
