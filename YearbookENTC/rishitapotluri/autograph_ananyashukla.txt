Hey Rishita,
Tu bahut amazing hai yaaar! You're so funny! I wish we had spent more time together. I can't forget the glow party night. Must say it takes guts to do so .xD
From always ready to bunk labs to staring at each other in exam and laughing because we don't know anything and you'd go out of the way to show me your paper. Good luck and I hope to stay in touch with you. :D
