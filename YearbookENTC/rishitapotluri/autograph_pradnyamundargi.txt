Rishita, I have always admired your outspoken and no non sense attitude. We have gotten through exams sitting on the last bench, made fun of tooo many people and danced our asses off at the glow party. I also remember how reluctantly your filled in for people during fashion show practices. Thank you for being such a sport. Never change and keep in touch. <3
