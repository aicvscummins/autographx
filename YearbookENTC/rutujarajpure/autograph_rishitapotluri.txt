Rutuja Rajpure,
I remember how I thought your surname was RAJPUT. I had confidently signed your attendance and you were like "Mai Rajput nahi hu". Those random emotional outburts we had. All those exams, we literally wrote the same answers. Sometimes, I'd just peek into your paper when you'd be stuck nad tell you,"Bhai, iska answer yeh hai, likhle"😂😂 . I have always had a parental instinct when it came to you 😂. Love you bro. I'll always look out for you. Stay in touch.❤️
