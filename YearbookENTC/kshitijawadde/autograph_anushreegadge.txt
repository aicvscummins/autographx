Hey Kshitija!
Initially we didnt talk much ...but in Btech when we became project partners i go to know you as an extremely fun loving and chill person! U have always made me laugh on ur jokes! I will miss meeting in the hostel for project work and then finally giving up and saying,”Jaude aadhi j1 karun gheu yarr!”I wish u all the success in life. Stay in touch!


With love,
Anushree
