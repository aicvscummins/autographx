Hii Arti,
     I must say you are the sweetest friend of mine. I am always inspired by your positivity and perseverance.
Whenever I felt tensed before exam, I straightaway called you and you were always there to share my tension 
and to solve my doubts. Also, you are the most helpful friend too.I remember, you used to have burden of laptop 
and library books in your bag, you still managed to bring those big GATE books to get them xerox for me.
Memories made with you while those engineering years are awesome. I will cherish them forever. All the best for 
your future endeavours and undoubtably we will be in touch.
With Love,
Poorva.
