Aarti,
You are the modt helpful girl I have ever met in Life...I would never forget that day when u taught me before BEEE ESE ...I knew nothing about BJT ..but thanks to you. Also through this four years your notes are life saving. I remember that in second year the xerox centre knew your name as he asked me "Aarti ke notes chahiye"..Your notes were fetched till that level.I was quite confused in the first year as I didn't knew you had a twin sister...Everytime I smiled at u ...sometimes you smiled back other times(Pooja) didn't. But Now I can identify u anywhere :) .Hope you get all the happiness and success in life.

With Love,
Anvesha
