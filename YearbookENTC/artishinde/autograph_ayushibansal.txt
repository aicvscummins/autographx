Hey Arti!
No one knew this before, but in the first year, I always - literally always - got confused between you and your twin and it has been embarrassing, I admit! It took a lot of time to not smile at her whenever i saw her around campus (because she didn't know me, hah). Anyway, now I know you a little bit, it has been real fun chatting up with you whenever we had a chance to talk. Keep smiling and all the best :)
