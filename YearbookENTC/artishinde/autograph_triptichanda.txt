Hey Arti!
Now that I think about all our time together, I regret not spending enough time with you. You were the coolest little lady of our class, just about on top of everything and I knew that if I had a doubt I could ask Arti and if she didn't know, nobody did.
I will miss all the time that we never had, keep in touch!
ALl the best!
