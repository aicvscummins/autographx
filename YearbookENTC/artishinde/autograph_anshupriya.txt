Hey, RTI
You are my friend for life. I can't even count the number of years for we have been the besties. From school buddies to college besties it has been a long journey but worth everything. And truly you are an amazing person inside out. I have always told you how ideal and perfect girl you are so much so that my mom will never hesitate to adopt you as her daughter(you know why hahaha). Anyway coming to the point, I don't know about anything else but I am really lucky and grateful for the friends I have had in my life and you definitely top the list. I hope the bond we share remains the same for our lifetime.
Love You,
Anshu Priya
