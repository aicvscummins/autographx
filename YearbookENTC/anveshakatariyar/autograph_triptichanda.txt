Hey Anveshaaaaaaa!
It is going to be horrible to not find you there when I go one storey down, I have become so used to you and all the things that we did together.
Nobody else has the same love for music that we share, both of us just know the perfect song to the perfect moment, and I love that we vibe so well together like that.
The endless gossip sessions and the oh so many snide remarks about you know who, you made it so much easier for me to survive my room and my hostel, I am pretty sure I would have slowly dissolved into depression without you.
I love the way that you have confidence in my dancing abilities and my know that there are going to be many more events coming up when we are going to dance together.
Not the last dance yet,
All the best!
