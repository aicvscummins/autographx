Hey Anvesha!
U are the best ...simply a multitalented individual .Thank you for the times we spent together! I will remember you as an extremely talented , multi tasker, a good listenerand an amazing friend!
I will remember our AI lectures when we used to play X & 0 lol and for that especially we used to come early to sit at the last bench haha. I will miss our last moment study for Ai and our Gandhaar makeup sessions at your room hehe! I will miss all our gossips and laughs we had together! U might not know this but i vividly remember it was ur first day and u came to class and u asked me”Koi baitha hai?” and i said no and u sat with me. After that we didnt talk but eventually landed in the same circle and i m so glad since i got to discover you as a very calm and hilarious friend! I will remember the moment when i was shocked to hear you sing so well and you playing it cool saying” yeh mein pehli baar ga rahi hu.pls mujhpar hasna mat” I will miss you ! As i m writing this to you i hope ur safe at ur home and all protected from the cyclone!


I still remember how excited you were to show me ur room when i snuck into bayakarve and i was the first one from localities to have visited you in hostel! 
Lets stay in touch and all the very best for ur future!:)


With lots of love,
Anushree.
