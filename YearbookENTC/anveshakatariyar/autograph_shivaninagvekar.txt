Hi Anvesha!!!
Actually I should say 'sleeping beauty' I clearly remember a day when you were very sleepy & I kept on kicking you to keep you awake 😅(Sorry for that) but now it has turned to our funny sweet memory.
The day we met in khar Ghar was fun.we have so many crazy funny memories together, and your cooking skills are awesome would definitely like to try out more recepies...lots of love❤️❤️
Meet to soon(Pune/khar Ghar/Bangalore)
