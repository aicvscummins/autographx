Hey Anvesha,
I can’t thank you enough for all help you have rendered. I remember I used to come to your hostel and you used to teach me programming. Then being lab partners and the exam hall fun. Sending notes to each other on whatsapp and going out after paper. That auto rise especially! I have a lot of memories with you. And I am glad I got a chance to make them and know you well. Be in contact! 
Wish you get success and happiness!
