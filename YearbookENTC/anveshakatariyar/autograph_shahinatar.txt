Hey Anvesha, 
        We have known each other from FY. You are very very strong in coding. This is the only thing I knew about you in FY. From there to talking in lectures, playing games in and out lectures. 
Thank you for the cake ( which I ate only once in that one third of a piece ).
PS- Please bring it again sometime for me only is hidden here. Someday we will have ANTAKSHARI DEBUT ok??
You are going to rock in Bangalore..
Stay in touch
