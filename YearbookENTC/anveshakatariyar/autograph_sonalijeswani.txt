Hey Anvesha,
When I first met you thought you were a very quiet and unfriendly girl.
Who knew i would turn out to be so wrong and we will go on to become the best of friends.
I could write in every page of this yearbook and it would never be enough room for me to tell you 
how grateful I'm to have you as my friend.
You have always been very helpful and supportive.
I will miss our fun filled gossip during labs.
Thank you for explaining me an entire chapter of management just before the exam:)
Thank you for all the beautiful memories
Love you
I wish you all the success and happiness in life
Keep in touch
(ALso thank you for listening pateintly whenever vinaya and i discussed something stupid:))
