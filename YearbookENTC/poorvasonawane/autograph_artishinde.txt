Hello Poorva!
You are one of my best college friends.
 I don't know how our wavelengths matched and I made an amazing, intelligent friend like you.I am glad the way things worked out for us as they did.
After college life, I wilI surely miss the post exam discussions with you and also like to thankyou for being a patient listener. 
You are very good person inside out and I feel very comfortable with you.Though you don't talk much but you have always been there to help me out whenever needed. 
Thankyou so much for everything and being in my life and I will cherish our friendship for lifetime.😍
Wish you all the best for your future and be in touch.


With lots of love
