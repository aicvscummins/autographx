Hi Poorva,
Thank you so much dude, for letting me join you guys for the project. It was really great of all of you.
You're an extremely talented person, thanks for saving us everytime with your codes. I really don't know what we would have done without you in the project.
We spent such nice time together in the last year, you're that person who is ever ready for help, that extremely shant and super smart of girl of class. I know you're going to do great. And I really really want to be in touch with you always. Love you:)
