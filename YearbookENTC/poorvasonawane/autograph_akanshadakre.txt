Hey Poorva,
You are very loyal and generous in nature which I admire the most in you.I really appreciate your dedication for anything. I remember the day when we both were giving interview for SAP labs and that tea-biscuits related incident happened how mad we were to do that….thing. It was really funny. Thanks for helping me in programming and giving me motivation for placements it means a lot for me . I enjoyed all the memorable movements which we had shared together for placements and in hostel. All d best for ur future endeavors!! ❤ ❤ Stay in touch!
With Love
