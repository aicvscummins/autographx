BARUDEE, 
        In the beginning I just knew you are TEJU’s friend who provides stapler and punching machine to everyone. And now I know every single aspect of yours. You are the GALI GUN of our class. You proved “Sir ke bal nahi Dil bada hona chahiye insan ka “ . 
Cheers to all our double meaning jokes, our endless talks. 
Thank you for stapler xd .
Stay in touch. 
I love you. And I will try this name( barude) won't come in Accenture.
