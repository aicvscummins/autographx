Hey Ashwini,
You are one of the coolest and chilled personalities I have ever met in my life. I just love how innocent and honest you are. Don't let anyone or anything change your persona. Remain the same. And thank you so much for all your help in my last-minute submissions (and especially your stapler ;) )
All the best for your future and may you achieve heights.
Loads of Love,
Anshu Priya
