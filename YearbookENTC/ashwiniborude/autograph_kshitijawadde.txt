Dear Ashwini(Bavlat),
      What should I write about you??
       I still remember how you had entered, at the first time, in our room 510 with your mother and little brother. I was so glad when I realized that we both roommates are going to be classmates too. I have seen your transformation from an innocent Ashwini to Galigaloch wali Ashwini.One thing I must say, You are really talented.In fact we are talented but we just need to get out of our laziness. I know you are going to do great in your life. 
My best wishes are always with you...
Love you so much!!
      See you soon in Accenture:)


With lots of love,
Kshitija:)
