Hey Ashu,
                 You are the reason why "Aashwiniiiii….ye naaa" song has a separate fan base in our group. Cheers to all the faltu chitachats we had in college...Those were epic useless conversations but still the memories to cherish.You are a gaaligun friend one could ask for. Being serious...Thanks for being part of Engineering journey. STAY IN TOUCH OTHERWISE  XXXXXXXXXXXXX 
LOVE YOU!.
