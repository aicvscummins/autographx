Hey Madhura, 
You are a very sweet and kind person. You were the first friend I got in college and I still remember, on my first day at hostel I came to your room as soon as I got to know we are in the same class and I asked you to take me with you for the first ever lecture in college!! Thank you for saving me in the beginning of FY <3
Keep smiling and stay the way you are! 
All the best!!
