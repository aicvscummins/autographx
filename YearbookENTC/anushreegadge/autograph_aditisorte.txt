Hello Anushreee..!!
Thanks for making my 4 yrs college life best.
You were "too much innocent" when I  met you in first year. You have been actually evolved in these years. 
I admire your patience for that 1-2 hrs talks after college (when I used to talk mostly ) , all silly doubts I used to ask regarding assignments. 
Thanks for always entertaining me. 
You are a very kind, nice and sweet person. 
Be as you are.Let's meet soon and catch up.
