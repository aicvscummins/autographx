Hi Anushree!!
We had so many great convos in the past years...we really bonded over our love for pets, especially cats! You have always been a great friend to me. Our IUCAA visit was so spontaneous and it was super fun too...wish we could have attended more like those events. 
You are very polite, kind and just an adarsh baccha! Never change...let's keep in touch!
