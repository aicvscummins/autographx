Anushree, itâ€™s really wonderful that I got to know you really. You the most kind, jolly and hardworking person I have ever met. We are really amazing time together during B.Tech. Starting from going to ARAI to planning our trips haha. You the most excited person also to go anywhere. I can count on you anytime I want. You are wonderful. Stay the same.
Loads of Love, Shivani Patil
