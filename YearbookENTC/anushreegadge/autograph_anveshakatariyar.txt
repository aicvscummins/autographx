Anushree,
I remember we used to sit together in first year...and our bond became much stronger when I discovered you Roll No.32...I being 31...That we would do all experiments together...Then we ended up with same group of friends from the original B2 Batch. I remember our crazy gossips about exceptional topics in the break. You are a very hard working Girl...I remember how we passed our one big hour in AI lecture...It was boring as hell...But it was fun too..we had been caught multiple times by the teacher and then we acted innocent..and the teacher believed us too.Hope you get all the  success in life.

With Love,
Anvesha
