Aunshree! I don't think I have ever met anyone as calm and composed as you. You are such a beautiful soul. I remember the time we gathered up on the secong floor balcony to watch the faculty performances. We laughed and screamed too loud and I had the best time with you. I think you're a really amazing person. Wish you the best for your future !
