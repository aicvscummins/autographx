ANUSHREE,
        I never saw an innocent person like you ( now you are not!!). My college survival kit.
Thank you for listening to my endless talks ( You never say i was boring so i am guessing you were enjoying those conversations). I remembered how you used to be a good listener in FY and now you are a talkative soul ( well you can thank me for that). You were there when I was sad, you were there when I was frustrated, you were there when I cried, you were there when I was happy, it’s always been you. You got tons of patience ( please teach me that).. Baki toh you know “Tension nko gheu mi ahe”. 
We are going to rock in Accenture. 
ILY
