Hey anushri, I know you're smiling right now also, because that's how you are.
You're literally the epitome of sweetness. Dude, how?how polite , sweet , kind and helpful you can be even in the worst situations
I still remember I approached you so late for the project group thing, and how you easily you understood me and took me in your group.I am so thankful for that.
We have spent time together due to project, and I am grateful I got to know all of you. We 4 never had a fight even once, and how easily you used to manage evrerything. You're literally the sweetest person I know. Trust me.
Thanks for letting me come into your group dude.
I am so lucky to know you, and please please stay in touch.
All the best anushri:)
