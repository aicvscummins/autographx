Hey Anushree,
You are very kind-hearted person yaar. I admire your humble and honest nature towards others. I recall how we both used to study together in SY and our last minutes revision before viva how patiently we used to revise each and every topic though there was very less time it was a great fun studying with you. I just loved talking with you every time be it related to study or anything else.I will those days a lot yaar. Thanks for always giving me motivation in exam and giving ur notes. Lastly, I would like to say that if u just don’t want something to do then speak it up otherwise u will be overburdened by them again and again which I don’t want you to be. So, just speak it up.Be happy always and don’t let others ruin your happiness. Stay in touch and all the best for your future!! ❤❤
