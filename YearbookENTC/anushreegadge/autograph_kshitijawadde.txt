Hey Anushree,
  We became good friends when we started working as  project partners.You are such genuine and innocent person I have ever met in college. I’ll always remember our last moment preparation of project.It’s memorable how we used to do ‘juggad’ during project viva. Always be the hard working and talented person as you are.
     All the best for your future!!
     We will always be in touch.


Love,
Kshitija:)
