Hey Rachana,
                       you are Eid ka Chaand for me…
I was happy to have you as a classmate but alas I could barely meet you according to your attendance record. Thanks for all the food items you specially brought for me. You are an amazing cook. So keep cooking and invite me for tasting it...I am always ready😛
                       It was good to have someone whom you have known before as a classmate.
Love , Shruti 😊
