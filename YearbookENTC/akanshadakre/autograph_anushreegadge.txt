Hey Akansha!
I cannot thank you enough for whatever help you have given me since Sy ! Ryt from allowing me to xerox ur notes to helping me revise all EDC/ICA experiments 2 hours before the exam when i had not studied even a bit ...u sat there with me taught me each and every experiment and thankfully i could pass! Not only this there are countless such incidents when u have helped me...ryt from our oral discussions to allowing me to come to ur room whenever i wished and allowing  me to use ur rooms wifi for giving accenture communication assessment when mine wasnt working and lt was the last day even if when u were not well and u wanted to rest! It really means a lot! U are truly a saviour ! I m really gratefull to have u as my buddy throughout my engineering years!
I want you to know that u are an extremely hardworking individual! U dont give up easily! Be the way you are and always keep smiling and be happy!Dont be stressed ,have confidence in urself and u will surely get what u deserve! I m sure u will achieve great heights in the coming years!  Wishing u all the success. Lets meet soon! 


With love,
Anushree.
