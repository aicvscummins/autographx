Hey akansha! 
We were roommates for 2 years and I saw how hardworking and dedicated you are. You're one of the people who keeps going at things till you completely understand them and I admire that. I'm grateful for all the memories we made, the all night study sessions before exams, the birthday celebrations and how kind you are! All the best, I'm sure you're going to do great in life! ❤️
