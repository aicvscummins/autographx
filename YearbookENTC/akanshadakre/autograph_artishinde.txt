Heyy Akansha,
You are the most sincere,studious and hardworking girl in our class.
You are really kind and have always helped me when you have... Thanks for everything.
I also remember the fun we had during dance practice sessions.
Just stay as you and may all your dreams come true.
All the best for your future and stay connected:)


With lots of love
