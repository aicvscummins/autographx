Hey Akansha,
     You seemed very introvert girl to me when we didnt know each other.
But later I found out that you are very friendly, intelligent and hardworking girl.
We made lot of beautiful memories in hostel as well as in college. We were together whether
it was SEED academy or a placement season.I will cherish those memories forever.
All the best for your future efforts and certainly we will be in touch.
with love,
Poorva.
