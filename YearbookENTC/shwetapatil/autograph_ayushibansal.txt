I'll miss you yaar. You're forever ingrained as the queen argument winner in my mind lol! Can we four please plan on video chats now and then after we move outta Pune? Let's swear on it. Gonna do that Bali trip too - maybe in a year or when you're married (kyuki sabse pehle teri he hogi) and Rishita is still talking to you-know-who on Gmail and I'm on my divorce number no. 5 and Nikita is pareshaan because of it? 

PS. We're still on for the video call tomorrow right? XD
