Hey Shweta! From second year to last year being in same batch we had so many amazing memories. I will always remember you sitting behind me during exams and helping me in need ðŸ˜Š, Thank you so much for that. You are an amazing friend and a really caring person, I wish I had a voice as delicate as yours. I wish you all the best for future and hope you will  stay in contact after college.
