Shweta Patil! I don’t even know where to start from. We’ve had our up then down then up and then down and the pattern just repeats. But it has been a treat knowing you. Whether it was a being a part of your birthday party or accompanying Rishita to your place for lunch..I think we did cross the phase of being friends because of Rishita. In our own unique way, I can safely call you one of the good friends I’ve made in this college. I still can’t believe you were scared of me, but I just hope we’ve gotten past that. These past two years were a lot more fun with you in them! The Lonavala trip will forever be etched in my memory. I remember you sitting in the front and helping me figure out where the road was because there was so much fog! For all those times that I’ve directly or indirectly hurt you, I really am sorry. You are a fiercely loyal and possessive friend, and I definitely respect that in you. I like how you always make it a point to look good. Stay the sweet,cheerful and loyal person you are.
