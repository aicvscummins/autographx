Heyy Shweta!
I remember spending a lot of time with you during Michelin interview process. On that day  I don't know how but  I feel so much connected to you and felt like knowing each other more closely.
But I couldn't not make up for it and the time flied. 
You are hardworking and dedicated person.Stay the same.😊
Wish we have got more time to know each other better.
Stay in touch and All the best for your future.


With lots of love
