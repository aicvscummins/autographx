Shwe, 
tu toh meri vaali hai.
The joey to my chandler.
Kya kya likhu ab, likhte jau toh word limit hi exceed ho jayega. You are such a possesive friend. Not complaining. I love you for it. All those honeymoon photos of ours are a proof. You have always been there for me, hating on everyone who didnt treat me well and crying everytime I shed tears. We have shed a lot of tears actually, some together, some because of each other and some for eachother. I will forever compete with you boyfriend/(s)😂😂😂.This definetly aint a good bye for us cause hum toh milte hi rahenge. I have no idea as to what I'd do without you. You have been a baby, All the "Bhai, tu nahi ayegi to mai nahi aaungi" se "Rishi, mujhe utarna hai,Washroom jaana hai, Haath dhona hai,uppar chadne me help kar na" takk, I have loved you for everything you are. Even the bitchy sides😂😂. You are my goddamn Twin. I am so glad mai tujhe apne group mai zabardasti laa di.
 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️(yeh le, dher saara pyaar😂😂😂😂.)
