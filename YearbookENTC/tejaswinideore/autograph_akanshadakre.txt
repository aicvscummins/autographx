Hey Teju,
Thanks yaar for always solving my silly doubts and giving me your assignments to complete. I will remember our good memories like how we used to revise topics just 15 minutes before the oral and that was the only time we were actually preparing for orals because we all know what we used to do in the hostel.By the way, you sing and dance very well. I like your carefree nature for studies and you are very talented girl. You grasp things very fast which i admire the most. Hope to meet you soon again.
Stay in touch and be happy always!❤❤❤❤
All the best for your Future!!
With love 
Akansha
