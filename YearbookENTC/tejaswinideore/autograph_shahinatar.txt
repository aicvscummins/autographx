Hey TEJU , 
    Few words are not enough to describe how I feel about you. You are my personal favourite..
You seem to be sanskari at first, but only your closed ones knew how you actually are.
Our Taylor Swift 2.O
You are TOM to my JERRY!!
You got tons of patience..
If you come to Pune just call me once.. I will be there with Biryani in my hand..
I am really not ready to say GOODBYE to you.. 
I know you are going to have an amazing life in Banglore..but keep missing me OK?
Thank you for all the assignments, lecture notes and showing answers in exam ( VERY FEW TIMES )
Cheers to all our successful trips, our THE BEST B1 BATCH.., our own little world in that large crowd..
I love you 3000.
( PS- I am gonna cry after this)
