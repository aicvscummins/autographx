Hey Tejaswini!
Thank you so so much for saving me always by giving me notes since literally Fy! U have amazing handwriting! Shwetali too! As an individual u are really caring of ppl around you and u are ready to help anyone in their difficult times! I will miss listening to ur amazing song covers!i have listened to only one ..but it was superb! >3 U have a great sense of humor! I have laughed at all our jokes! Though we have talked mostly during our batch practicals and rarely after college, i will cherish all the amazing times we had together! All the fun we had during Gandhaar! Words are falling short to list down countless moments when i was grateful for you! 
U will be one of my closest friend forever! Stay in touch and all the very best for ur future! 


With love,
Anushree.
