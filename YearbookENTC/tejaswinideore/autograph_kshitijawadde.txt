Teju!!
You are a genuine person with a soft heart.The one who always listens and understandsap others. 
I have a lot of good memories with you. Thank you for teaching the things one night before the exam and the special thanks for clicking the good pictures of ours not good looking faces.
    Always stay the way you are!!
    Best Luck for your future…


Love,
Kshitija:)
