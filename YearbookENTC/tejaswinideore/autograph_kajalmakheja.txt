TJ!!!
Nobody has ever made me feel the way you do.You were always there for me.
You were always there when i cried
You were always there when i was sad
You were always there when i felt like a failure
You used to try to explain me whatever happened just let it go.Thank you for telling me that true friends are not those who just stand only at your good/bad times,but a true friend is one  who always does it till the end and you are that true friend of mine.Love you TJJJJJJJJ!!!❤️❤️
Gonna miss you and your creepy smile😭😭😭
All the Best Chutiya!!!!
