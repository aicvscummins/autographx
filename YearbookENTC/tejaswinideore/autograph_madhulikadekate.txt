Dear Tejaswini,
If you weren't there how would I have ever gotten any help in exams!! Thank you for helping me throughout the three years of my engineering. You have been a great friend to me. I remember I used to tease you about how me not liking Taylor swift and you used to get angry!!. We had fun. I'll miss all the talks we had and me forcing you a little to take bunk. I'll miss you. I hope we stay in touch forever. I wish you a great future ahead. I know you are gonna shine like a star! <3
