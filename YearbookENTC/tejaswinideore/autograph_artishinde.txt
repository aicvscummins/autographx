Heyy Tejaswini!
You are a sincere and studious girl. We haven’t spent much time together but the little time we spent during dance practice sessions was really amazing.
Thank you for teaching me the dance steps, and for helping me with your notes.
I miss all the time we haven’t got to spend.
Wish you all the best for your future and be in touch.


With lots of love
