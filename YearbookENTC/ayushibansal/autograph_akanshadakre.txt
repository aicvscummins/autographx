Hey Ayushi,
I admire how calm, clear-headed and hard-working you are. I recollect how we use to complete ICA practical in SY so fast yaar and then do time pass. But then mam was jealous of us and she used to send us to help others. How rude she was yaar and do you remember our practical viva revisions?? How we used to sit anywhere and just revise each and every topic till we get that,it just helped me a lot but it was very funny. By the way thanks for helping me in diagrams and completing the write-ups always. I don’t remember i said you this or not but without you I can't think of doing my practials alone it's very boring.So, i always used to find someone or else not do that practical. You are a very good companion with whom I enjoyed spending most of the time in labs. I will miss you yaar !! ❤❤ Stay in touch with me always. Hope to meet you soon. All the best for your future!! ❤
