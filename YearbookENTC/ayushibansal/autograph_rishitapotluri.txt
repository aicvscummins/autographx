Chingu, 
What am I even supposed to write, Your yearbook photo pretty much describes us(My reflection), We have stuck to each other for so long, be it our birthdays or our C-numbers or even our first-year roll numbers. We have always had each other's back.
You have seen me go from having the first gulp of alchocol with you(the first sleep-over) to asking uncle to make a peg for us😂. I will miss crashing over at your place, going out and the few parties we managed to drag our asses into. Ahh, the dreams we dreamt together, I promise, We will do all those things one day. And BALI is going to be our first trip after college. Don't be overwhelmed that this is over😂, I will always bless you with my existence.
I love you.❤️
