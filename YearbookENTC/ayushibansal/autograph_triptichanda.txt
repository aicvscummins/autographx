Hey Ayushi!
I know we drifted apart after the first year but the time that we did spend together was great!
There are a lot of what ifs, but then I am happy that we do have some happy memories to fall back on. I remember this distinctly that I was sitting with you on the first day of college and you were the only one I told that it was my birthday.
I used to love seeing the art that you made and posted and I hope that I see more of it. You are talented.
All the best!
