Hey Ayushi!
U are an amazing person! Like seriously ...if we are unclear about any topic all you need to do is have a fruitful conversation with  u on that topic and all ur doubts will be cleared! U have this attitude of not giving up so easily! I still remember how you used to perform all experiments in lab completely by literally doing it and understanding by heart...while we ppl were just fooling around if we didnt get the output LOL!...aur tu madat karti thi jinko jinko nahi aaya unko!
Wishing u all the success in life ! Stay happy and stay connected:)


With love,
Anushree
