Heyy Aayushi!
You will always be the person i met on my first day of the college..I will  miss you bro!..You are the forever style diva(still can't forget the day when you tied a braid in your ponytail)..
I love how you managed all the trips and outings we had..you are one of the smartest person we have..I'll miss sitting next to you in lectures while you were reading those wattpad stories,will miss our first fall from my bike behind the Mech building(idk why i have to fall everytime you sit on my bike),will miss hanging out street shopping on FC road...I still remember the night nikita and i spent in your house staying up so late..Love your aloo methi dude..ughh i am gonna miss everything..
And yes we 4 have to do video chats from now on..And do not forget the Bali trip..love you!
