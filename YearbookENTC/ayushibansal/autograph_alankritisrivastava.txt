Aayushii! Chingu! Jo bhi bulaun tujhe, tu cheez toh badi mast hai. I’m always going to always think of you when I listen to that song. Well you always were Rishita’s friend but somewhere along the way I developed this apnapan wala feeling for you. I know we never spoke a lot but I always felt this weird connection with you..probably the “It takes one to know one” wala connection. I know you’re an introvert but I really hope you get out of your safe cocoon someday. You have a lot of wonderful things to give to this world...so do it. Also, try not to be so hard on yourself all the time. And I hope you never have to go back to your kajal smudging phase. Stay in touch! All the best for everything!
