Hey Sourabhi!
We were in the same batch for 2 years but i only got to know you in our summer internship! Those were the amazing 2 months (*half of the time i wasn't even there) of engineering life and u made it even more special! Without you i wont have survived the internship! U are an extremely helpful , hardworking and friendly individual! U always checked up on me ,called me when i was going through my difficult times ! U kept me positive throughout it! I feel blessed to have met you and to be ur friend! Also u have a beautiful smile! All these moments we have spent together i will cherish for life! Lets meet up soon! All the very best for ur future! Keep smiling and be happy!


With love,
Anushree.
