Hey Sourabhi,
You are very loving in nature. By the way I like to irritate you a lot while chatting or in college. Thanks for always telling me answers in exams and teaching me how to copy. Lastly, I would say that I will never stop disturbing you and please don’t forget me. I will miss you yaar. Be the same as you are. All d best for ur future endeavors!! ❤ ❤ Stay in touch!
With Love
