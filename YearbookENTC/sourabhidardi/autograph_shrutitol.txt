Hey Sourabhi, 
     You are such a cute and innocent person. My Engineering journey is incomplete without you in it.I always took your side when anybody teased you and used to make fun of you after shutting them up ...You always said that I stabbed you in the back but  that was my way to show how much I love you.You are just like Ratnagiri Haapus ….sweet and meeting only for few days…
All the best for your future…..Stay in touch !
