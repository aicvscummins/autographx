Hey Sourabhi! I miss being the roll number before you. You’ve been an amazing friend. We haven’t been much in touch these past few years..but I couldn’t have gotten through first year without you. You’ve been there for me always. Whether it was me talking in toota phoota marathi or me removing your hair clip all the time..you’ve been very patient with me. Humne itni zyada masti ki hai 1st year mein. Thank you for being such a good and smart lab partner. Please stay in touch! All the  best for everything! I love you <3
PS: Don’t forget me :(
