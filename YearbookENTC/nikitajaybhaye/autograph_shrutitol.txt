Hey Nick,
               Remember how we used to spend time in your hostel discussing on useless topics for hours and we continued to do the same in the college when you shifted to your home. Also , we used to tease each other for no reason. Lot of memories to cherish are there. 
You had been a wonderful friend.
Thanks for being part of my Engineering journey.
Stay in touch otherwise I will kick you.
All the best!
