Heyyyy Ananya,
You are bubbly, cheerful, savage and a peace person. As of us we really didn’t attend clg to have clg memories together but our hostel memories are lit!!!
I am so gonna miss you and the fun we had. And ya really miss the part where you use to come in our room to take a look in the mirror. Never gonna forget that plus there are many things which are inappropriate to say here. Lol! 
Lots of love to you, 
Unnati
