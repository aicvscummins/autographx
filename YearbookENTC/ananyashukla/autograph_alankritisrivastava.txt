Ananya Shukla. You’re a very cheerful person. Gandhar 2k19 was what actually brought us together and it could’ve never been the same without you. We had soooo much fun in that fest. I have a lot of more amazing memories with you..there’s actually more good memories than bad. We had our differences on the professional front and I’m sorry I let that get personal too. You’re a very loyal friend. And you’ve been there for me a lot times. Sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly..thank you for being there when I needed you. I really really hope we get past these differences and do stay in touch! All the best for everything!
