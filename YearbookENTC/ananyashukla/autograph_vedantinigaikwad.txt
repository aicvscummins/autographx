Hey Ananya, 
You are my bro. Okay? I really don't know what to write for you. But these 4 years wouldn't have been bearable if you hadn't been there (even though you didn't exist in the first year :P). You are my pseudo cat roommate. Thank you for all the late night conversations and teaching me before exams. I swear I would have like 10 backs without you😂. We are BFF's and nothing can change that. I love you from the bottom of my butt. 


Love, 
Veda
