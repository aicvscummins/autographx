Hey Ananya,
We hav most of hostel memories than cllg…coz cllg tho hum bohot kaam aaye hai…from being strangers to  sharing notes one night before exams we grew up in these four years….nd how can i forget midnight snacks… I remember calling each other in the middle of night saying tuzhe kuch khana hai… 
I am gonna miss all this…
Thanks for being the amazing part if this journey❤️💯
All the best for future💯
