Hey Ananya!
We didn't know each other at all I think before the Neon Party incident, not one of my greatest moments I can tell you that. (please do try to forget about it in the future). You were so great and responsible back then to someone you didn't even know and I really appreciate that. Good luck with everything ahead and thank you! :)
