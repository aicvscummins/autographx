Hey ananya!
I'm so glad you're going to be in Bangalore, definitely going to come and crash in your house all the time just like the hostel. I've troubled you so much in last few years! I'm going to miss trolling people together, mostly I'm going to miss having someone to talk to, being high with you,  lab experiments with you, look at pretty pictures of the sky you clicked, I'm really going to miss you!! You creepily showed up into our pictures in first year:p but I'm glad we all stayed friends through the ups and downs. I love you, all the best for a new city and a new journey <3
