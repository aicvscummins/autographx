# Hey, 
I remember the time we sat in front of mechanical building and spent an hour talking and gossiping about the “slap”; 

It’s been so much fun hanging out with you, getting drunk and being high with you and then talking about absolutely ridiculous things which god knows will ever make any sense. 

I can see us a few years down the line sitting in someone’s apartment laughing about the times we were this young. Smoking in bathrooms to legit finishing assignments last minute. 

Hostel and college wouldn’t be the same without you
