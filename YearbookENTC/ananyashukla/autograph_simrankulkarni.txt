Firstly, why do you have an excel spreadsheet in your folder? :P 
I remember when we first met in 2016 you were really homesick and i was running out of ideas to comfort you :P
Over the past four years i have seen you evolve from a shy girl new to the city to “bhai sutta kidhaar hai” and “bhai aapan keh laag gaye” 
Touch meh rehna aur jugaad karti rehna :P 


Love you,
Simran
