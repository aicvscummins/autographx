SHIVANI PATILL, 
You are my friend from DAY-1. Our friendship has been through all the phases. You are that person jiski sab lete he….par jiske bina group adhura hai..When i will die and if i ask you is there anything you wanna say.. Your ans is gonna be “YOU IGNORED ME IN 3rd sem”. I still don't remember me ignoring you. Our short trips, our incomplete plans, endless gossip, meaningless drama. I am gonna miss everything. But i know we are going to catch up soon. ILY.
Yours Shahin.
