Hi Shivani!!
I'm so sad that we couldn't go to Goa as we had planned due to CERTAIN virus(😠). I was looking forward to that trip and spending time with all of you. Remember that Boeing internship prank?😂😂 Thanks for taking it sportly. I am glad that we could be friends in the past few years. Let's keep in touch!
