Hey Shivani ,
                     You are innocent and sweet girl who gets nervous on any little situation saying you are the most depressed girl in the world and tackle the situation gracefully. It was fun to prank you and see your excited face while being pranked and then angry one after everyone started laughing. I remember I once told you that I know your future...And by seeing nothing on your hand I predicted your nature which was correct and future that it is bright and you have many chances for going out of country which I am sure is gonna be true.
Thanks for being part of my Engineering Journey.
Stay in touch.Stay blessed. All the best!
