Shivani,
You're one of the constants I have made in college.
I admire you for your hard-work , dedication towards your fitness goals.

You're such an entertainer and digesting your crush on new guys was so much fun!
Still remembering the time you told me to click the picture of your crush lol xP

It was great to know you and looking forward to more outings with you in Bangalore.
Stay same.Hope u get all happiness and success in life.
Take Care!! 

With  Love,
Anvesha
