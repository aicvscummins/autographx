We knew each other since IITPK and I will forever remeber you as the girl discussing 50 shades at 7am! I think we created so many memories in just one Manali trip that the list will go on forever. From preparing for JEE to having the best 2020 new year party, we shared a lot of laughs and tears. I have never met a person with a more joyful and positive aura. Hope you never change and always keep in touch. <3
