Hello Shivani Patil,I enjoyed making fun of your diet plans.
But,I hope you'll start having more than one meals soon.
Â We had so good memories in and outside college campus.
I met you on day 1 of college. I saw a girl,talking to almost 10 people at once.
You never changed in four years. You kept talking even when no one was listening.
 I'll miss that.You are always ready whenever we plan something. 
Let's meet soon and complete your list.
I wish your Bangalore plan will also work.
All the best for your MS or job and upcoming future.
