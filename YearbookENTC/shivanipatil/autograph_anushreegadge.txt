Hey Shivani Patil,
 thats what i have been calling u ryt from FY just bcoz we had 2 shivanis in our grp! I will remember you as a very hardworking and extremely jolly individual! U are the one bcoz of whom i got to see so many places in Pune i had never been too!(i never used to go out LOL!) I vividly remember our Pune places to visit wali  wishlist and literally how excited i was to complete it thoroughly this year! Although i wasnt able to come along to each of them but i m glad i covered most of them with you!
And i love ur Doraemon key chain! I wish i could steal it from u hehe! 
Pls stay the way you are ! Wanna see you achieve new heights ! Wish you very best for ur future !Stay in touch and take care:)


Lots and Lots of love,
Anushree.
