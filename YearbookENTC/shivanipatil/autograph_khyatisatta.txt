Shivani Patil,
You are one of a kind person. If at all my engineering career doesn't propel, I'mma make a living out of displaying you in a museum <3
Jokes apart, you are such an important person to me. Anytime I'm down, you make me feel like I have achieved enough to not feel so.
Thank you so much for that.
You're stuck for another year with me in Pune and guess what? we'll probably go together.
I meant what I said in Manali.
Love you!!
PS: Let's go to Miami on a Wednesday after Go Corona happens?
