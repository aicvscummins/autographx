Hey Shivani,
I very clearly remember our casual debates on random topics during lunchtime. I really loved how you so positively agree on the disagreements. And it was indeed an amazing experience with you in the fashion show prep as well. I love the friendly bond we share.
All the best for your future endeavors.
Loads of Love,
Anshu Priya
