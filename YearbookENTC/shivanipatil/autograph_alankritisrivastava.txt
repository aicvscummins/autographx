Shivani Patil! I love you re. I’m sorry for being a constant pain in the ass and irritating you so much, but well I do have a video declaring my undying love for you! I hope that means at least half of what it means to me, to you. And I might not always mean the things I say, but I definitely mean the things I write. You are an irritating yet adorable soul. We’ve gotten pretty close in the past year. I remember Rishita biting your head off because you got your Control Systems’ tut signed. You were such a huge reason Labs were fun. Pestering you and annoying you was the best part of my day. It was my way of showing how much you mean to me. I like how you used to take everything sportingly and even manage to come up with some sarcastic comeback. Thank you for being such an innocent and naive person. There aren’t a lot of people like you left in this world. I hope you have a lot of more adventures like you did in Manali. Stay in touch Shivani Patil! I love you!
