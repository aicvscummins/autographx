Hey Shivani!
I know we didn't get to hang out a lot but whenever we did it was fun. 
From when I occassionally bumped into you in the library, where you had the best suggestions for the books to the time we spent in the fashion show together.
Your spirit is amazing and I know that you'll do wonders.
All the best!
