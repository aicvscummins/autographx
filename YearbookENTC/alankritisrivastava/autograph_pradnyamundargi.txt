No one has ever teased me as much as you have, but you have also loyally finished my dabba. Although we knew each other in school, we grew quite close in these past 4 years. From messing up your hair on freshers, to learning BEEE and Digital Electronics with you, we have created amazing memories that I will cherish forever. You've been my crisis manager for every exam, tolerated my every "I'm gonna fail" and trusted me enough to sit behind me on the bike. And most importantly, I could have never had the colourful 4 years without your entertaining drama and theatrics. Now I honestly do think- what would all of us have done without you? Who would have made our bad bads better is it weren't for you. So thank you for being the joy of our group. Keep in touch till the end of time. <3
P.S. Thank you for coining "Pradu". It really stuck.
