Heyy Alankriti!
You are the most confident and bold girl I have ever met…
You have got amazing leadership qualities and that reflects in each work you do.
I always love the way you manage everything seamlessly..and take into consideration the opinion of everyone involved.
I really got impressed by you when in the EEP session you expressed your desire to join defence....I really loved it.
We have been in one batch for four years and you have always been very friendly and helpful.Thank You so much for everything.
Just be as you are and keep shining as always.
Love to be in touch with you in future.


With lots of love
