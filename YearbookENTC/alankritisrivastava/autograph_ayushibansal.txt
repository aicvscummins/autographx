Alankritiii
God! We used to be afraid of you in the first year, but now you're in the very small list of my mates I've laughed with and loved it! Remember the lonavala wali trip? that semi awkward khadakwasla wali trip? You'll remember the Neon Party though (it's good one of us does, sorry). You are a great friend Alankriti. It was great to know you even it was so damn little! Stay in touch, maybe? Keep kicking some asses till you're 70! Good luck :)
