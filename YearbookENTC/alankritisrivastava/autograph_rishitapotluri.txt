Alankriti,
Ab start bhi kaha se karu. It started with my whole group being shit scared of you, us bonding in second year to me running to you for every slight inconvenience in life. You have been there through thick and thin, seen my good sides and the worst ones, dealt with all my rona-dhona and stupid tantrums. You have always guided me through things. Voh baat alag hai ki maine suni nahi aadhi cheeze ;). You are my mumma-pegion. I will miss you. I will miss going to college to study for exams, I will miss going out on dates with you, I will miss the maggie sessions(which were a follow up to our most sacred ritual ), I will miss you forcinng me to do things I am not comfortable with(I'm thankful though), I will miss going to the swimming pool, only to go back and stuff our mouths with earthen-pots ka Chicken. I will miss the "Lets go learn MMA days and lot more things. Also, I know this aint really a good-bye kyuki I'll keep pestering you hamesha-hamesha ke liye.You have made me a better version of myself.
I love you. ❤️
