Hey Alankriti!
It was amazing knowing you..I know we had both good days and bad daysðŸ˜‚..But i still remember our Lonavla trip together..the time you came to my house to eat 'Puran Poli'..The time I dragged you to my birthday Party..
You deserve all the good things in life..
All the best for your future..
Don't worry I'll keep on getting your updates from RishitaðŸ˜‚..
