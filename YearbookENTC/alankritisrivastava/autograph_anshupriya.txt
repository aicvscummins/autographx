Hey Alan,


Though we have not spent much time together but it was really inspiring to see how confident and bold you are. Always very enthusiastic and a joyful girl. Your presence in the classroom just cannot go unnoticed. And I am really happy that I was a part of the Fashion Show which helped us bond a little more. Just be the same and keep smiling.
(Ps. You have a beautiful smile and contagious laugh)


Loads of Love,
Anshu Priya
