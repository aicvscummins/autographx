Alankriti!! Habibi! I don't know how many names I came up with for you in the last four years. You're the closest person to me! Thank you for everything, I'm going to miss walking around the lanes of Karvenagar with you, go to random places and chill, always knowing I have someone I can tell stuff to sans judgement. You're the best gift Cummins gave me❤️ I'm totally going to tell everyone you meet in life the story of how you banged into a glass door and the security guard laughed! I'm going to miss going to random colleges and sitting for hours for publicity and of course MITAOE will always be special😂 Thank you for being such a good friend, I love you so much. I hope that we're reading this together a few years later. Always know I'm going to be here for you, only a call away❤️
