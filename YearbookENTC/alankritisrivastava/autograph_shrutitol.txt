Hey Alankriti,
                    I still remember your first ever addressing to the class for first year CR election..Because you were tired of repeating the same thing again and again and then you said "Hello , my name is Alankriti Srivastava for the third time" in your loud and clear voice and then whole class bursted into laughter along with the teachers. Yes I admire your voice.
You were the long lasting CR of the class and been scold most of the times by teachers.But still supported mass bunk everytime. I wish I could get some of your confidence.Thanks for being part of my Engineering Journey.
All the best! Stay in touch.
