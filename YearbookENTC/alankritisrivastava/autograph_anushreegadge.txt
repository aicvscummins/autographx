Hey Alankriti,
U are an amaaaazing person! Not only do u have greaaat sense of humour but also great leadership skills and you always carry around with you the  “never give up “ attitude! We started interacting briefly from Ty innovation and i m soo glad i decided to volunteer for our branches event! U made me feel comfortable and asked me if i have any trouble understanding or if i cannot stay late ...and u made arrangements for that! I love how u make everyone involved in any teamwork we were doing!Thank you for being there like a guardian...literally i felt aare alankriti hai na...kar lenge hum ye pakka...she will guide us!
Hope to meet u again someday ! Stay in touch and all the very best for ur future!


With love,
Anushree:)
