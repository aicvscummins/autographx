Feels like we’ve known each other forever. From sitting on the rooftop in wadias and talking about the guy I had a crush on--to--how are we still talking about Arora of all people 6 years later!


Lol, I am kidding. We’ve been through so much if I started listing it down I will grow a long beard. All the ups and downs, all the times we’ve bunked college, both this and wadias. All the times we’ve tackled drunk people and then all the times we’ve been the drunk people who needed tackling. 


The longest relationship in my life and wish to know you for the longest time. Please keep in touch--don’t break up :p
