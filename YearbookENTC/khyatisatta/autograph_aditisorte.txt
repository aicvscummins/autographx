Hey Khyati..
You are just good at whatever you do, May it be studies, dance, singing, anything..!
I have known you from 1st year and I wish I would have known you from FC.
And yes, I will miss all the fun we had troubling Shivani Patil and we will definitely throw her one day..
You are amazing.
Stay in touch.
