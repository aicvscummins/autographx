Kheti my love!! If I start writing all the memories we have shared, I could go on forever. Never in my wildest dream did I think that you'd mean so much to me. These past four years have been a rollercoaster but friendship started with Mandarin. From being the most distant individuals, to the closest sisters ever, we have created so many memories. I remember our crazy sleepovers and the night when we sat talking through the hours instead of studying for MGMT! I remember our dog feeding sprees and our random pani puri cravings. I can't believe 4 years are up and that we may not be seeing each other every other day. But I do feel happy knowing we will actually achieved the goals we sought after in first year. Maybe not every other day, but I'll sure be seeing you in the US. Thank you for standing by me. <3
