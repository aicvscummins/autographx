Hey khyati!! You're such a cool person! You've got dance moves that amaze everyone! You're confidence is from another world. I'm glad we're friends and have so many memories together. I'm going to miss running around in college for the fashion show and never for any classes, bitching about the teachers and  literally going to every movie that we could! I wish we'd had more tekdi trips over the years but let's keep working on our list in the future as well! Thank you for everything, all the best ❤️
