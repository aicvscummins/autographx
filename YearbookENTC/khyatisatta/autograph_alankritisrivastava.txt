Kheti! You were always the most calm and level headed person in the group. Over these years, I have seen you grow tremendously as a person. From being a girl with shattered MBBS dreams to a successful engineer, you’ve really really come a long way. I still remember that time in 1st year when there was a chance that you would go for BDS, and you were late for the exam that day...we had this really sinking feeling because we just didn’t want you to go. And then you entered class panting like a dog. I’m really glad you showed up that day. You’ve been the mediator between Pradu and me, the one person who’d just tell both of us to stfu when we quaralled over nothing. You finding your keys in your bag will be the way I’m always going to remember you. And I’m sorry for taking your keys with me that day. I would’ve never even tried to lose weight had it not been for you. You’ve been my motivator and inspiration in the fitness department? Remember that kanji aankhien wala guy in the gym? Or just those long walks we took. I really do not know what I’m going to do without you being rude to me all the time. I kinda enjoyed that too. Thank you for being my chauffeur when I didn’t have a bike or just didn’t want to drive. You’ve put up with a lot of crazy shit you probably didn’t want to be a part of..just for us. And that’s what makes you so amazing. I know we’ll always be in touch..so that’s not something I’ll say. I’m just bummed that we won’t have our movie before exams ritual anymore. Continue getting a kick from sugarless nimbu paani! I love you!
