Hey Khyati!
I still remember the day when we randomly met in Fy and how we started to hangout together and then ultimately landing in the same batch B2! Over the years we have shared many happy moments together ! during our AI lecture and in general!
Although we didnt talk everyday but we spend some quality time together in our elective classes!
Thank you for taking care of me when i was really really shy around ppl in FY! I wish u best of luck for ur future and stay in touch!


With love,
Anushree.
