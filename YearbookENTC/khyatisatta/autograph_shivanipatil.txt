Hey there, from first year sitting back to back to last year, we were stuck together. I know I annoy you most of the time haha but hey in my defence you will never forget me (wink). I had many amazing memories with you from going to the movies randomly to bunking classes whenever we felt like it. The most amazing memories we made were during our Manali trip. You are an amazing person and a wonderful friend. I hope we will catch up  in future, Stay the same and all the best for your future.
Loads of Love, Shivani Patil
