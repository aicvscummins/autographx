# Hey, 
I remember randomly talking to you in first year and then you legit tolerating me. It’s been so long since that but I guess you’ve gotten used to tolerating the randomness xD 

Man, at this point I would have legit failed first year if it wasn’t for you xD

I’m gonna miss you, please stay in touch
