Khyati,
You are quite a friendly person one can always seek help from. We gelled quite well in the first year ...mostly in Labs and Tuts.Then we had to undergo batch shuffling and we somehow lost touch..But it was really a treat watching you dance at our senior's farewell and we joined u too..really enjoyed that day.You will always remain a dear friend. Hope you get all the success in life.

With Love,
Anvesha
