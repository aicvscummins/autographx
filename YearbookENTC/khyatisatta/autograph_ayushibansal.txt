Hi Khyati!
I always thought you were so cool, right from the start. After the second year all of us started hanging out together and had those full blown belly laughs at the back benches of our classroom. You are such a great person and so so bold. College days were fun with you guys! Good luck and stay awesome! :) 

PS. Never forgetting the sudden Khadakwasla trip ever either!
