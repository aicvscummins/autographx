Hey Khyati,
                  you were the reason I could merily complete my MC lab. I always wondered how you could drink the whole bottle filled with green tea..I tried it but couldn't do it(Well I am addicted to Iced tea now!) You always tolerated to all my bakwas in the morning and didn't say a word about it….!I will always be thankful to you for this. And also I learned most of the MC coding from you..Not kidding though….
I always admired your coding skills, your true reviews about movies (English) ,books which I had hardly heard of. You were wonderful lab partner and I used to miss you when you were absent.And yes you were the only girl in my friend list who is learning Mandarin to go to Singapore or China and work in core electronics field.Be careful now.
Stay in touch.All the best.
