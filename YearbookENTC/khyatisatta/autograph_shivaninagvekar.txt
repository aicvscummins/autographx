Hi khyati!!!
You are the first person I met and I sat beside during the lecture it was BEEE and you helped me Solving a question then further I came to know you wanted to go for medical.I always enjoyed talking to you maybe issues regarding exam fees or talking about tutes and many more your company is just awesome….
I know few things went wrong and you were mad on us I apologise for that
I would like to say not medical but you are definitely a brilliant engineer.
-Best whishes 👍👍
Keep in touch 😊
