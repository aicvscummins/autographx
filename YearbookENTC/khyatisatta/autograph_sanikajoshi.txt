Hey khyati, the one memory of you I remember is in probably the first week of college, it was our 10am break, and I accidentally forgot my wallet at home, I didn't know you tab very well, but you without asking me got snacks for me with you. It really touched me, and I will never forget it. I know you're going to do great. I am so thankful we interacted because of fashion, you're extremely confident and lovely on runway. 
All the best:)
