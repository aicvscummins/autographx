# Hey, 
We bonded over talking randomly that one day after college about everything that’s wrong with college and I couldn’t be more grateful for that day. From randomly going on bike rides to talking all night. 

I miss all the days we were roommates and I miss you. You were one of my closest friends and I hope we can still get that back. 

Please stay in touch. I love you :))
