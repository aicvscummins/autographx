I've spent more time with you than anyone else and you also know we have so many memories that a 100 pages won't be enough. I know not all our memories of each other are good but the good ones definitely beat the bad ones. You are an amazing friend and you were an amazing roommate. I've loved you with all my heart and I always will❤️ I don't want to look back 10 years later and regret not telling you this. All the best for everything. Also, of course we're staying in each others lives for a long long time❤️
