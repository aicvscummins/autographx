Hey Veda…
I know we’ve had our differences and fights but it’s been great knowing you. Those project discussions,hanging out in your hostel room or well partying on my birthday we’ve had an amazing time together. I honestly really wish we had more time to sort out things between us or that we were sensible enough to not let things go wrong in the first place...but you do play a significant role in my life. Remember those FPL lectures in first year? We used to always be the first ones to finish our programs?Oh! And then there was also your birthday party where we got pizza and sat on balloons to burst them. And then there are also the not so in our senses evenings we’ve spent just bonding with each other. Despite everything, it’s been a pleasure being your friend Veda. Let’s try staying in touch? All the best for everything!
