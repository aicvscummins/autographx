Vedaaaa,
You're not a pro but you coloured my hair!!! That's the utmost level of trust I can have in anybody. I know your love for cats and it's oddly beautiful when you send me IG videos of cats which remind you of me. :')
Neither is this enough to write about our friendship nor we know how to be sweet to each other. So here's a big thanks for everything. We're going to be long distance friends. I love you ❤️
