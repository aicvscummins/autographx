Hiiii Veda, 
We first got along for the class dance in the first year. I enjoyed our time choreographing together be it now or be it then. I knew a different version of you before you joined the hostel but after you did I got to know the amazing you. Stay as crazy as you are! Be in touch and I’m glad we met!
With lot of love, 
Unnati.
