Shahin, you have the magic to spread happiness where ever you go. You are the worldâ€™s best friend and amazing person. How can one not be your friend I wonder? You are the light bulb of our group, the jolliest person I have ever met. We have been friends since day one. You have shown support and faith in me like no one else. I know I have made you angry many times and you being you, you always forgive me. I had the most amazing time with you in this college. I wish you all the best in life and all the happiness in the world.
Love you, Yours one and only Patil.
