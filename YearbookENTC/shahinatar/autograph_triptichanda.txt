Hey Shahin!
I know we didn't get to talk a lot but I wished that we had. I say that because all the time that we did get to spend together I realised how awesome you were and what I was missing out on.
I would go as far to say that you are what made B1 batch the batch that it was. I will miss you.
All the best!
