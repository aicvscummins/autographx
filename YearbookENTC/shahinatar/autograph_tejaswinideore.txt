Hey kween,
You are the person who's smiling all the time no matter what, you make everyone laugh and that's the thing I love about you. I'll never forget the way you cared about me whenever I got sick, calling to check on me was the sweetest thing you ever did(considering you don't usually call people XD).  Be it planning trips or bunks you were always forward. I'll miss your nonsense talks <3
All the best!
(ps- Biryani treat is still pending)
