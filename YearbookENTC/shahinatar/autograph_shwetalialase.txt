When I looked at you in first year ,I swear ,I never imagined that we can become such nice friends.Thanking you is not enough for all the things you have done for me..That moment when everybody was shocked How I come first in class ,u know it was just because our hardwork.. Enjoyed a lot our hostel days...thanks for planning such beutiful trips (such a awesome planner) I'm so happy that I have some more years to spend with you and add some memorable moments in our memorybook..Thanks for always caring , understanding me ...I can write whole book on you.. hahahaha....Love you baby don
