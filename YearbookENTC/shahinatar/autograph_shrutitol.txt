Hey Sine,
               You have really been Sine of my Engineering life...Had to deal with it on daily basis(😜).It all started with you being my Lab partner and splitting our work in Mouse and keyboard. From sharing notes  to being my hostel mate to taking care of me when I wasn't okay to planning awesome trips to sharing your tiffin to sharing your paapad and sometimes buttermilk in mess with me to discussing some emotional issues to now saying goodbye(formally), we have came a long way! Remember this is not over...Ye toh shuruwat hai ..TATA is close to your house ...Meet soon.
Love you..
All the best ..And please find your cosine ASAP.
