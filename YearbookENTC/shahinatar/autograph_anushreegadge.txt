Hello Shahin!
First of all i m so glad we are placed at the same company coz i know theres this friend of mine who will take care of everything for me as you have been doing since Fy! 
Shahin… u carry magic with you everywhere….its like an aura of happiness. Whenever you are around i feel peaceful coz i can open up my heart to you and you listen patiently! I have always been amazed of how helpful and caring you are towards everyone! U are a hardworking individual! Seriously! Hats off to you ! U used to travel from so far to college everyday and still had great energy in you throughout the day! Ur truly ‘CHOTA PACKET BADA DHAMAKA’. I m so grateful for all the times u have tolerated my silly questions and silly doubts and been there by my side both in my happy and tough times! It means a lot! 
 I will forever remember your dialogue”Anushree! Tu tension nako gheu mi aahe na!”:)
Ur my closest friend and i m truly happy that we met and have become best friends!(although i dont say this to you often but ur really special to me!)
I want you to know that ur really amazing and keep being by our sides as you have always been! 
I had been an introvert since FY and u being an extreme extrovert initially i really felt...no way i cant be friends with her..but i was sooo wrong… being friends with you is the best thing that could happen to me in college! I want you to know ur the reason i could rediscover the real me!(which i had lost for like 2 years) and it means a lot!
There might be times when i would have hurt your feelings please forgive me for that! I was truly an idiot! Remember i will be always there for you no matter what !
Please stay the way you are and all the very best for ur bright future ! i know ur gonna rock it!
See you soon!


With love,
Anushree
