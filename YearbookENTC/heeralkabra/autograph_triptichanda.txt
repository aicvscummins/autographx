Hi Heeral!
Where do I even begin? I remember the day we met like it was yesterday. Both of us were walking around the college, you with your mum, me, looking for a familiar face, just trying to find where we were supposed to go.
I could have never known that I would have found a friend for life that day.
It is funny how many times before we nearly met but didn't completely, it was like Ekta Kapoor of our lives knew when the perfect time would be and she was right. I absolutely love you to bits and I can not imagine the life that I am starting now where I wouldn't be able to meet you everytime that I wanted to.
You are an inspiration darling and I know that I have found a gem of a person and a friend in you.
You know that if I miss you too much I am just going to show up at your house and hang out with your mother right?
