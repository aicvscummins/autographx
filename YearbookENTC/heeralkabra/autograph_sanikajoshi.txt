Hiral, i am speechless .i don't know how to thank god for you, I  love you for such a kind, humble and good human being you are. How you so cute and innocent dude? , Your simplicity startled me.
Yaar thanks to your dabba, me and pooja literally use to fight for it. Woh hostel mein reheke ghar ki yaad sirf tere wajah se nahi aati thi.
You have been always there with me for my tough times, which i could share only with you, because such a good listener you are. 
You're that friend who everybody needs , whom i can call at 2am and would cry my heart out and she will pateintly listen.I am glad you did not unfriend me for all the times i annoyed you. I am forever greatful to you to bring us six closer, you're genuinely the glue of any relationship.This place is really small to write for you, because I can't explain in words how much you matter to me,. I miss you hiral, i miss US.Jaldii RD se shaadi Kar. if i would to sum you up in one line, i would write, 
Tu bohot acchi insaan hai hiral, Bohot acchi. If I'll be even 10 per like you, i would be a way better human being
