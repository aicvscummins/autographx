Hey Heeral,
You were one of the few people I had first interacted in college but it was through Apurva that we finally bonded. And I am really happy that we did. I love how straight forward and honest you are. You are really an amazing person inside out. I just love your personality in general.
Keep smiling.
All the best for your future.


Loads of Love,
Anshu Priya
