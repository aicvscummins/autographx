Heeral,
I remember u as a person who has never let the child die in you. I remember that carefree attitude in the first year and paticularly that chemistry lecture And also when you fell off the bench while changing seats in third year ...You have always been the entertainer.Thanks for entertaining us specially B2 in this hectic four year routine .I adore your fashion sense and loved your lab gossips .Hope you get all the happiness and success in life.

With Love,
Anvesha
