Heyy Tanvi!
When I look back to the time we spent together...I could recollect all the memories we made during lectures, labs, completing assignments, preparing for orals, canteen talks, and whatnot. You were everywhere. Thank you so much for everything. 
You are the most sincere girl I know and a wonderful person at heart and my lifetime friend.
Stay in touch and wish you all the best for your future.


With lots of love
