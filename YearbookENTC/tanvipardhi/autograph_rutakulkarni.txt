Tanvi...
What do I write about you, gurl? You probably laugh more than you talk, you pick up the worst moments to laugh, you have always been positive and happy. We have so many memories together with our gang.
On the first day of our final year we both came in the later half of the day to attend one single lecture, but ended up bunking that and went for lunch at Level 5, spending a heck lot of money for just the two of us and filling our stomachs till we were ready to explode!!
Because of you, we all watched the movie SARABJIT ;)...which was okay-ish, we had a lot of expectations but.... You and I were neighbours during our exams and I remember us both not meeting each other's eyes cos we probably would have had laughed the entire time! I loved when you all four became my canvas during the MOOD INDIGO...I woould had never known my make up skills if it weren't for you guys! 
You have been such a great friend Tanvi!! You are always a delight to talk to...you are fresh and funny...we often laugh at our own jokes not caring how childish they are! You are often in your own world and do crazy things...like when you were about to fall and had to take my support! Which you will always have but try to maintain my dignity, okay? The way we had studied for BDA will always be engraved in my mind...we mostly disturbed Shruti, Divya and Kanchan!
We still have many more years to strenghten our bonds and are on the brink of an enitre new chapter to begin.
Always smile the way you do, spread laughter and stay the way you are cos you're perfect the way you are!!
To our fiendship, the years to come, to the memories we are gonna make, to the new horizon!!
Lots of love, 
Ruta
