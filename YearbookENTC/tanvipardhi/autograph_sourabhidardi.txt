Hey Tanvi, 
In these four years our friendship has grown stronger and will continue to do so. Thank you for bringing us your mother's handmade food to college so that we would feel like home even while staying in hostel.
Your smile is very cute and always keep smiling like that. All the best for everything.
With love,
Sourabhi.
