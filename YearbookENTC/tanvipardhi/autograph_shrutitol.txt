Hey tuntun,
                 I am really short of words pahile describing our bond and memories over past 4 years. But I am glad to say that from pranking me at midnight to listening to all my bakwaas talks….you were there by my side.
                Remember when I fell and taught you dressing the wound and then you did it successfully? You were more nervous than me while doing it as it was your "first time"!
                 We both know that we can  talk with each other on any useful or useless topic we want at any time ...mostly midnight.
                 I am unable to write further due to tears….Bella Ciao!
