Hey Tripti!
We’ve been together for 4 years now and yet it was the fashion show which actually brought us together. You have pretty creative and amazing ideas (Atlantis was your idea after all). The fashion show practices and debates while finalizing the costumes will always be etched in my memory :p You’ve made our entire class proud by being a part of Robocon. It’s been a great graduation journey with you. All the best!
