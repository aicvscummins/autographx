Hey Tripti,
                Most of the time spent with you was in the ROBOCON room. I mean you were the reason why I entered that room. I always had you as my ideal in first year..How you balanced your studies along with it. Also, you were so  focused person in the room that you deserved to be "the operator".You also helped me whenever I needed. Thank you for being part of my Engineering Journey. Stay in touch!All the best. Boeing is really gonna have a skilled engineer .
