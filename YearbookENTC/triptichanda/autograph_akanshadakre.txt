Hey Tripti,
You are a very helpful, smart and talented. I just get inspiration by your confidence. I donâ€™t know whether u remember this incident or not that u told me about your experience after that IEEE C coding competition when I first talked with u. You just told me how you used to participate in the competitions and what all difficulties u face while doing that. It helped me a lot. Thanks for guiding me it was because of your guidance now I like to do coding more now and I am somewhat good at that.Stay in touch.All d best for your future!!❤❤
