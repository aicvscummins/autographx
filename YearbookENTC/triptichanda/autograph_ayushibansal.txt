Hey Triptiii
Do you remember the first year fresher's? You were going to catwalk I think and you came to the four of us, cooped up on the third floor of Mech building and I clicked a picture of you posing against the window of one of the classrooms and we wished you luck to rock it! You did and you haven't stopped yet. Honestly? I have looked up to you for so many things in these 4 years, it's funny! You have such a great personality and I hope you keep on shining, good luck! :)
