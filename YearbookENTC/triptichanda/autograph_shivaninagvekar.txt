Hi Tripti!!!
I Don't know whether you remember or not but 3 years back I wanted to apply for passport and had many doubts regarding it that time I contacted you we had a nice chat and it really helped me.
We dint had many talks as such but you were always present maybe anvesha taking about hostel or harshada talking about B1 batch.
I will always admire your talent and the skills you have…. looking forward for a great friendship 
Meet you soon in Pune or at Boeing
Best wishes 😊
