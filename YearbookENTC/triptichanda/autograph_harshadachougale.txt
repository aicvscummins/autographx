Hey Chanda…..
I really appreciate your jugadupan 😁. Had amazing three years (first year we didn't knew each other). Labs were fun with you, specially viva. I'll never forget final viva and exams😜. You showing me paper in bindass attitude and not caring about invigilator was commendable. I have learnt a lot from you. Your deep knowledge about things and multitasking is really appreciable. I laugh remembering you taking us to SWE ke lectures because of less people attending it. And yes many outing are pending, some we can try to make it successful.
Wish you success…
Much love ❤️.
