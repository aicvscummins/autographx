Heyy Chanda(this one is my super favorite)!


When I think about you..one word that strikes me is a multitasker. I think you are the most active member of ENTC B who participates in almost all extracurricular activities and manages everything seamlessly. I highly admire you for this.
We have spent a lot of priceless time together in Robocon and made memories that I would cherish forever. Thanks for everything.
Genuinely I believe you are a personality to behold. 
Though I regret we haven’t got much time to know each other personally:(
Anyways, be in touch and wish you all the very best for your future. 


With lots of love
