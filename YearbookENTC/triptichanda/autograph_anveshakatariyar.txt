Tripti,

I came to know you when u enrolled for Miss Freshers and then I saw you in my Hostel..I knew you as the girl who makes the best chocolate cakes xP.
And then I have had all my experiences from playing cards,dancing ,having some great taste of music,studying till 3 A.M. in chilled winters (that too in the balcony) with you.You are a constant who visits me each day w/o fail whenever u are in Hostel.I will miss you a lot.And the way you call me"Anvesa" is adorable. I have learned many card games in these four years..thanks to you and Anagha.
It was great to know you and looking for to meet u in Bangalore soon.
Stay same.Hope u get all happiness and success in life.
Take Care!! 

With  Love,
Anvesha
