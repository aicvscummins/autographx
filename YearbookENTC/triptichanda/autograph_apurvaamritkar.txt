Hey Tripti!
You are definitely one of the smartest people I've ever met. I will always rememeber our little mid day outtings to Starbucks and The brew room haha damn I loved doing that with you. I don't know how I would've survived college without you to be honest.  I know I've made a friend for life. I know you are going to rock at everything in life and you deserve the absolute best. I love youu and you'll always be in my heart.
