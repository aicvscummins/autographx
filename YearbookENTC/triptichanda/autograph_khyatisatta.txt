Tripti,
I wish we would have had more conversations to outweigh the awkward conco we had at the Python workshop in first year.(I'm pretty sure, you muxt have thought if I knew anything at all)
I hope you have a great life ahead and being the amazing and bold woman that you are, I don't doubt that for a second.
Cheers! <3
