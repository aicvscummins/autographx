Heyyy Shivani!
When I think about the time we spent together...Rangoli pops up in mind.You are my forever rangoli partner and an amazing friend for life. 
I remember the topic less talks we had after MC lecture. We have made so much memories that would last for long.
You are a wonderful soul.Just stay the same.
Wish you all the best for the new phase of life.
Don't forget me, always stay in touch.😊


With lots of love
