HII NAGU,
    You are the most responsible person i have ever seen (when it comes to submission , exam ). From batchmates to friends this journey has been amazing!!
Remember our ending project?? (Hope we will complete that some day)..
Try something other than study or study related topics ( it's fun.. believe me)
We always joked about you  ( in your presence of course ) but you are very inspiring, focused and very intelligent (of course)..
i will always remember that your number is saved in TPO's phone..
Thank you for all the assignments, last minute revision.
Thank you for not killing me when I keep on talking nonsense( other than study ) in group study..
All the best for your bright future.. Stay in touch <3
