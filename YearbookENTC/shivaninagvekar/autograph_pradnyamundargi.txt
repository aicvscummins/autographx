Hey Shivani! You were always were a roll number after mine and my saviour during exams. I love that you have such a wonder and creative mind. Although we had our ups and downs, I'm glad we could get past them. I'm glad we both love cats. It was nice to have known you over these past years. Good luck for the future.
