Hey Shivani,
Never had i ever given ppl pet names but unknowingly i used to call u Shivu or Naggu sometimes , this shows how close u are to me! U are really an amazing person, really hardworking and helpful too! I still remember how badly i wanted to come to ur house on ur birthday this year! I was missing you so much that i made a small video for u and sent u on WA ...though now when i look back i feel i should have video called instead! LOL! Though we didnt talk as much with each other in TY as we used to do in fy and sy i still felt reunited with a person whom i have known from ages ...whenever i used to meet you:)There were times when i unknowingly had hurt ur feelings and i apologize for that ! It was an awakening moment for me to reflect on our friendship and what i mean to you!
 the most memorable moment for me is our teamwork while preparing Shivani’s costume! We had so much fun! I had missed my creative self since years and you helped me bring it back!  I felt in that moment i would want to stay with you and our grp for yet another year and the fact that i have just started to openup to you guys and i want to do so much for you all on ur birthdays! I will miss all this! Time went by so fast but every moment i spent with you i will cherish! Your cute laughs and hilarious jokes !i will cherish them all! Please stay in touch and all the very best for u future! 
Meet me soon!


With love,
Anushree.
