Hi. Shivani ,
I think you are too serious for academics ,studies,that I used to wonder what you do in free time like after  exams..
Now, I'll know it.
Let's have fun in Bangalore.
I remember one project we all did it together, you were too focused and I was too much not focused. :(
We are totally different personalities, but, I like to work with you. 
Let's meet soon and hope we'll get joining soon.
