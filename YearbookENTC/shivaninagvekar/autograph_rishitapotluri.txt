Shivani,
Thanks for the endless notes you provided through out these 4 years. 
We bonded so well in the bus, our constant ranting and nagging.
The accident I had when driving past you and you constantly telling me to be better at driving(hahah)
You are the most innocent and calm person I have come across.
Stay the same.
All the best❤️
