Hey Shivani,
I remember our first interaction very clearly, it was a few hours before our Maths paper in the library. We came to you with so many doubts and you very patiently answered everything.(Tab hi pata chal gaya tha tu topper hai :D ) Thank you tons for all your help.
Loads of Love,
Anshu Priya
