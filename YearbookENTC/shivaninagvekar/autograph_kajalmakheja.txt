You are a great decision maker i should say.I love the way you plan everything so systematically.
Thank you for always motivating me whenever i felt homesick.Thank you for the home made food that you used to bring for me during the internship and college.
Gonna miss all the fun i had with you.
Love you Shivani❤️All the best for you bright bright future!!!
