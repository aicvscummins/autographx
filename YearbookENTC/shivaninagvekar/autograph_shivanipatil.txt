Nagvekar, you best friend anyone can ask for. Thanks for studying with me. I donâ€™t know what I would have done without you. To our small eating sprees to planning trips we have made a lot of memories. You are amazing, smart, hardworking and very dedicated person. I wish you all the best for future.
PS lets meet in Bangalore 
Love, Shivani Patil
