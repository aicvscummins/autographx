Hey Shivani,
It was a great experience to have a friend like you-so helpful and kind.
You were the one person i could turn to for notes even on the night before the exam.
You have always motivated me to do something productive and useful.
Thank you for that.
And also thank you for all the wonderful memories.
Wishing you all the success and happiness in life.
keep in touch
love you loads
