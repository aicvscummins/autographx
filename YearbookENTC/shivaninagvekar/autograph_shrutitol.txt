Hey shivani,
                    We say that we did not have much of a bond but we have been part of "The Goa trip" and cancelled it so we are friends for sure.
I remember our useless talks in the corridor.
I can definitely say that you have a very bright future as I can see your sincere efforts towards everything you do. 
Stay in touch. All the best!
