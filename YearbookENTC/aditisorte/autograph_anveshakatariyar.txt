Aditi,
We have been in touch right from the first year...I noticed you first time when You sat with Anushree..You were really that girl who doesn't care much about what others say...You were so confident ...And one of the few ppl in first year with whom I could gel on coding...Later you became a marathi grammar Teacher. And then we ended in same project group....It was really hilarious how we fooled our project Guide..escaped from her.Our last minutes prep..and believing that our Guide will not understand what high level work we are doing ;).
Hope u get all the success in life and let's meet in Bangalore /Pune soon.
