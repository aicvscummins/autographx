Sorteee!!
I have  said "Sorte" so many times that by now, even when you are looking at this message, you can(assuming;) ) hear me yell. I really really appreciate the few times we bonded. Be it those lab sessions, you sending me assignments to write from or even outside KB Joshi, contemplating ki "gurgaon kisko chahiye yaar". I love how you are so calm and peaceful all the time and I wish, one day, just one day I could do it. You truly are abeautiful soul. Keep in touch!
