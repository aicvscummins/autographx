Hello Aditi!!
I still remember how we met in FY . It was our lunch break and few of our classmates were having some discussion outside the classroom and thats how we got introduced to each other! And ofcourse there was Shahin too:)
 Since then we have been really good friends….from celebrating my first birthday in college to travelling to places in Pune , you have been there with me all the time and i m really grateful for that! 
You will be remembered for your savage replies to whoever it is and constant laughs we had together , and ofcourse those talks we used to have outside my house ..”Aare we used to study so much in our 10th and 12th std and now look at us we don’t even care!” We used to have all those funny discussions , gossips and some serious life talks too!! Yes  i will truly miss each and every bit of that!
As i m writing this , it still hasn’t sunk in that college is over and we won’t be able to meet as often!But our good times spend together will forever be in my heart!
All the very best for ur future! And dont forget ...me and Shahin are gonna come stay at ur place in Banglore so be ready for that! We will have lots of fun! 
Hope to see you soon! Take care and stay in touch.


With love,
Anushree.
