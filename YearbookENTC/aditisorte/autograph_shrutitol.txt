Hey Aditi,
               I will always remember you when I will hear the song "Khalibali ho gaya hai dil….Aditila gas zala" .Man we danced like hell on this song on our trip to GMRT. Also , ED with you was fun..I always wondered how your throat used to jam everytime we had to give presentation...And bread jam activity would have been boring without you😁 
Anyways I will miss our crazy and useless talks.
All the best (to Boeing as they hired a crazy person😜)Stay in touch!
