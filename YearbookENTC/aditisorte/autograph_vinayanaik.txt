Hey Aditi,
You were the first person i met in college and right off we were together. One day certainly we will complete that saga and actually publish that book i am sure. We had great fun. And ofcourse one thing that i have learnt from you will always be there:- “Mansa bhettat ani vastu miltat”. This learning was a turning point in my life. Thank you;p I wish you all the success in life. Much love.
