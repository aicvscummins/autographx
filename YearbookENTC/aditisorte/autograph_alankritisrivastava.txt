Sorteeee! I don’t even remember the last time I called you Aditi! The last 3 years have been so much more fun because of you. You’ve been my partner in everything! Labs, exams, viva, dealing with Shivani Patil...you’ve always been the more calm one telling me ki chod de, dekh lenge. I couldn’t have asked for a better roll number before me. Thank you for always being there! Stay in touch! All the best for everything!
