Aditi! ata kay bolu. From first year sitting back to back to last year being in the same batch we had amazing memories. I still remember annoying you during labs, convincing you to bunk lectures and labs with me, those were the days. You have been amazing as a friend; I know I can trust you with anything and everything. I hope you don't forget our sudden trips and unsuccessful plans. I wish you all the best for future. Letâ€™s catch up in Bangalore.
Ps. I won't take you to eat pizza next time, I promise.
Loads of Love, Shivani Patil
