Aditiii Sorted, 
Assal Punekar ( Ms. Auto Correct ). We are friends from Day 1. 
Remember once we were discussing in the library about our ego problem and we came to the conclusion that if we ever fight then no-one's gonna take the lead.
I am so glad that we actually never fight!!. 
You are very special to me. Let it be assignment or exam study even if i did not complete it , i always knew you are gonna be on my side ( INCOMPLETE TASKS)
I am gonna miss how we used to call each other before exams and literally discuss everything other than syllabus for the first 30 mins and then immediate seriousness.
You were my stress buster (PS- i am still gonna call you, if i ever feel stresses)
The day when you got placed i literally had tears , that's the day i knew you are my friend forever. 
Stay in touch ( You don't even have any option especially if you are in Banglore).
Cheers to all our planned/ unplanned successful / unsuccessful trips..
Keep troubling me, I will do the same..
