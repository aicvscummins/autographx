Hey divya,
I knoww we haven’t spent a lot time together. But you are a very sweet and helpful person.I remember those exam days whn we were next to each other and dat also on first bench!!! Well, but den also we managed to copy😂 and I do remember we had same practical question for one exam...and you were like i haven’t deleted the folder...u can copy the code...and it was a relief...Thanks for helping me out there…Thanks for getting me stuff from kajal too. 
I wish the best for you ahead…All the best💯
Thanks for being a part of this amazing journey❤️
