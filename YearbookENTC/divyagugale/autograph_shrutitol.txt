Hey Divyu,
                This is the most difficult part of the autograph writing ...As they say write something good about you. .like is it even possible to say anything good about you?
                 You owe me half of your degree...For completing your indices while dectating submissions to you, for frequently writing your absent letters , filling your placement forms, marking your attendance and uploading your autographs in the yearbook.
                 On a serious note , you are a first ever marwadi who is not kanjush. I hate to say this but I love you.
And there is no question of saying stay in touch...Because what would you do without me...And also what would I do without you?
Love,
Shruti☺️
