Jai shree Krishna Divyaaa!

Daring, Dabangg, Dangerous, Dazzling, Delightful, Dimagwali, Dildaar, Dependable. Every adjective describes you perfectly. You have truly earned your title as "Jugaadu person". I've seen you doing jugaads for all these years and many of theme were for me😘 Remeber MOOD INDIGO wale jugaads?? VIP list wala jugaad? And Coffee nation wala ID jugaad?? 

Kisise nai darti Divya coz you are the Daring Divya. You have tolerated and at times, clearly told your project guide that 'I don't know about you but I AM ALWAYS RIGHT', coz you are 'nayele pe dehla' Divya. Only two marwadis are close to me. And among you two, you are jyada Dildaar Divya. Teri awaj se sab darr jate hai kyuki tu hai Dehshati Divya. Since we all know how dedicated you are towards Krishna bhagwaan, you will also agree ki tu hai Dilwali Divya.

All those moments from mahabaleshwar trip, mumbai trip... Local ka safar, street shopping, street food, night outs and everything will be cherished for life💖

Sa ra ra ra... Kabira sa ra ra ra... This line, this song will always remind me of you. And while dancing, I'll try to recollect all your signature dance moves. Especially, na na wali step. We have to explore a lot of places in Pune that we had planned, so the plan is still on... Teri meri Bday party is still on!! We have so many things to catch up!

You were the best partner for treasure hunt and snap hunt coz usme bhi you can do jugaad :p  We've endless memories of bunking and having spontaneous plans. You are the only person I know who never ruined up the plan💕😘
I hope you get to meet Parth Samthan in person ASAP, biggest KYY fan😜 I can write a book on you but I'll stop here coz you know how much you mean to me. Love you Dangerous❤❤❤

PS: Drive safe, eventhough you are Drooom-Droooom Divya.
