Divadee, 
        From criticizing college teachers and bus- system on bus stops in FY then being in the same batch then becoming friends then food and travel partner and then project partner and now friends forever we have been through every part of friendship. 
        I am gonna miss our jugads in every submission let it be tutorials or mrudul ma’am ki project assignments. Our whole project is JUGAD LOL.You are that person for me who is loving and irritating at the same time ( but love is more than irritation ) 
 I always wonder how come you don’t take tension of any single thing. I know your corporate life is going to be amazing. Keep meeting me. Let’s plan more trips together. ( and DAL BHATII is still pending )
I love you a lot .
* Yours shahin
