Hey Divya!
U are the most jolly , fun loving and the most chill person i have ever met in my  life! I really admire your Mantra -”Go with the flow” . It best suits you. Be there any problem u have the solution for it! That sort of perseverance really amazed me! If theres one thing i have learnt from you is to be with our friends no matter what happens! U are the true definition of friendship!...u truly a gem! I am grateful for all the times u have helped me and been there for me even if we weren't that close initially! U are just an accepting person who easily becomes friends with anyone!
I will forever remember our memorable trip to Tikona fort and our ride from the railway station to the foothill of tikona! I wish i could take much more trips with you ! i cant believe its already the end! Pls meet me soon and lets go on such random trips and have fun together! 
 I wish you all the success in your life and stay in touch:)


With lots of love,
Anushree.
