Harshada,
You are one of the strongest ppl I know ,I remember you were one of the most hard working girl in the first year, always into studies and all... and then you decided to let this image crack ...You became one of the ppl who enjoyed the college life for real..You are really a fun loving person .Hope you get all the happiness and success in life.

With Love,
Anvesha
