Heyy Harshada!
We haven't interacted much in the initial years..but in the last year we really had good bonding.
We have spent a lot of time during Michelin Interview process..and you really kept me motivated that time.
You are really hardworking and smart person.
Just be the same.
Thanks for everything and all the very best for your future.
Always be in touch.


With lots of love
