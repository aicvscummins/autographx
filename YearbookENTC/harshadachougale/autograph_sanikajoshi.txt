Harshhhhh, thank god you shifted to hostel in second year, because of which I understood what an amazing person you are dude, my neighbour, my floormate , my classmate, probably I have spent the most time with you. We have spent such good times together in hostel and in college. I really don't have enough words to thank you today. You are there each and everyone, keeping your work aside, how helpful someone can be.
From teaching me maths, from handling me , and I would never forget how you were so involved and helped so much in Rotaract. Today, with a very big thank you , I also wantt to say you a very big Sorry,if I would've hurt you anytime unknowingly in hostel and also sorry for that ( jaldi uththi jaa yaaar subah waala lecture everyday )XD. Your neeend, kya karu mein uskaaa. I like how you always give best advice ever.
