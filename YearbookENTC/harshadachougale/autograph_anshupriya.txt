Hey Harshada,
Though it took a little more time for us to actually bond without any misunderstandings, I am really grateful that we end up becoming good friends. With time I have realized that you are a very sweet and humble person. Just remain the same and keep in touch.
All the best for your future.
Loads of love,
Anshu Priya.
