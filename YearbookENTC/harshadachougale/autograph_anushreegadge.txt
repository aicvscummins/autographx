Hi Harshada!
Ur are a great individual always ready to help anyone in need! I am really grateful to you for taking care of me all the time! Teaching me whats right and whats wrong! I still remember how randomly we met when i asked you if i could join you for lunch and you straight away said yes and made me comfortable! Thanks for tolerating my silliness haha. U have been my saviour right from Fy to Btech ! When we had our sudden plans of going somewhere to eat or watch movies and i used to never carry around cash with me...ur were the one who used to always save me! And after all this i still didnt carry around cash..lol...i m so bad!.and u were there for me still! I will never forget how u taught me to put proxy for people when i was being a coward..hahah! U taught me how to stop being so serious and start having some fun! U have always been a jolly person! And my buddy way back home! Thank you so very much for always being there for me! I will really miss you and the amazing times i have spent with you throughout my engineering!Although , i regret times when i wasnt there for you or i didnt understand you and didnt be by your side even after all this you were very understanding of me!  I have not told you this ever but ur an amazing person ! and i hope i would have appreciated you more when we were together and spent more time with you! All the best for your future and i know you will achieve all your dreams!! Hope to meet you soon.Take care!




Lots of Love,
