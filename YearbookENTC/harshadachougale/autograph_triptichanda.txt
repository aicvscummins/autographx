Hey Harshada!
I don't think I have enough words to say how amazing of a person you are or even how great of a friend you are.
These four years have been a journey of discovery and you have been there throughout. I did not even know what I was missing in life until you came along with all your awesomeness.
I feel horrible about the fact that we did not get to spend enough time together. Oh the many outings that we could have planned! Brought the whole batch together!
I can't even count the number of times that you have been there for me and I really hope that I have been there for you even a fraction of those times.
Through all the projects, submissions, labs and even that horrible day with Goldman Sacchs. I will never orget that day and the only reason that I was able to get through it was because you were there with me.
I am going to miss you a lot and I hope that we stay in touch!
