Harshada, I really don’t know where to begin. We had our fights but in the end that flourished our friendship. I’m really lucky to have you as a friend. You are the most caring and selfless person I have ever met. I know you are still angry at us for always taking you to pizza place but I promise after lockdown we will have a blast one last time before we graduate. Stay the same always okay and stay in touch.
Love you, Shiavni Patil
