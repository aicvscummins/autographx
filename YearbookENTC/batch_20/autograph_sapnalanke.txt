To Div B,
We are not only the most exciting class,but we have experienced everything together from mass bunks to hod’s office.we have experienced everything to an incredible extent…and the best thing is that we have had each others back.
As these phase comes to an end here...I will miss our class...I will miss comming late, giving proxy,sharing notes on whatsapp group,planning those mass bunks…every single moment here…
I wish everyone the very best in their life.
Thank you guys for being part of this beautiful 4 year journey ❤️
