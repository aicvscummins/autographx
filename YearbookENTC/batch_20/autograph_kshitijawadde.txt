To the Most Popular Div,
        Coming from a small town to the metro city ,it was really challenging for me to settle here.
On the 1st day of college, all of my school friends were asking me “So how boring was the 1st day in girls college?” And I was like “ Yeah,not bad”. I was regretting why I have been allotted to the Girls’ College. Initially I never felt that our class bonding will be so strong.But 2nd year onward “It was Wow!!”  
       We started bunking the lectures, having fun ,hanging out with friends,teasing the teachers and so on....A lot many people think that being in a girls college must be boring or having a lot of restrictions. But I’m so happy that all of them are totally wrong. Being in girls college means 
Having a freedom to live our life the way we want, Coming to the clg on T-shirt and pajamas,
Comb your hair or not,Having a proper makeup isn’t a big deal here.We can enjoy being ourselves because no one is going to judge you here.
     We all have grown up in these 4 years…..
        From Hi To Abe Oye, 
        From Can You give me your assignment To aee tera complete hai na chal idhar de fir,
        From what will teacher say To Jo hoga dekha jayega,
        From Can I sit here To Abe sarak udhar,
        From Just give me a hint,I’ll write ans To Abe pura dikhana
        From attending all the lectures To the mass bunks
    We have become THE DIV B .
       I survived here because of you people.No matter what we always got each other’s back.
 I’ll miss how we used to share questions and answers after viva, how we used to circulate the answers in the exams,our chitchats and everything. 
        A Big Thank You and A Big Hug to you people.
        I wish I could live those moments again with you!!


With Loads of Love,
 Kshitija :)
