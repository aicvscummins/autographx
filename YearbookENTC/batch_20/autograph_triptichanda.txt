Hi All!
I never thought that I would have this much fun during my engineering. Whenever people used to talk about missing their college and friends I used to laugh at them thinking, itna bhi kuch khaas nahi hai.
But in all the bunking, the hating on teachers, the scheming, the gossiping and the continious effort that made us the best class ever, I did not even realise when I completely fell in love with our class and each and every one of you.
No other class could even compare. I know everyone says that, but I checked. And they all suck. The love and the support and the positive encouragement that you guys have all the time is amazing and I am going to miss you all very much.
Hoping that this is not goodbye yet
