To our class ...the div B:)
Being from a coed school and college ...i had friends circles which were not girls only and so when i got to know Cummins is gonna be my engineering college ...i felt like ohk..idk how i m gonna survive for next 4 years!? But i was so so sooo wrong! All the perceptions we have about all girls school or colleges is not always true! These were the best years of my life! This is when i have been the happiest and all the credit goes to each and everyone from our class! Our small interactions with each other and all our teamwork that we had in every decision was simply great! The feeling for cheering for our class during Gandhaar and being happy when someone from OUR class becomes a panel member!This is what made us special! We were there for each other and we were there together in any situation it be and thats what really matters! 
It hasnt really sunk in yet that our journey together is over and we all are now moving on to our own ..new chapters of life!But i will cherish these memories in my heart forever!
Times are really difficult ryt now ..still i hope that we are able to say our proper goodbyes to everyone:)Thank you so much for everything Entc B! >3


Load of love,
