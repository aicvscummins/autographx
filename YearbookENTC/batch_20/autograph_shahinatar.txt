To my the division B, 
I guess all the people who are always ready to bunk come in B ( B for Bunk). I remember the first day of college when I saw all the girls around. I actually thought my college life is going to be boring. But NO, I was wrong we do more fun than boys. Here are just a few advantages I got for being in girls college, we can literally wear anything ( nobody cares ), we can sit anywhere, no Male teacher is ever going to scold us and there will be unity. When it comes to bunk we will be remembered forever. Every sem we get warnings and we literally give written documents that we are not going to repeat mistakes ( but actually who cares right?) . 
All the best guys for your definitely bright future. ( definitely because if you gone through cummins we can do anything).
