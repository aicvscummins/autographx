To my fellow classmates,
Trust me I was very sad when I found out that I was allotted Cummins- an all girls college, since I was studying in all girls school since 4th grade (yeah ik it's sad and funny at the same time). I kept whining about it the whole first year like most of the others. But the real fun began in second year, I got to experience the fun of being in all girls college like wearing whatever you want -I've seen girls coming to college literally in sweatpants, dancing like no one's watching, getting to do everything on our own, checking out boys during Gandhaar and much more. 
Our bond as a class has become stronger every year (rather everyday). Be it bunking whole day or even a single lecture we were always together with the Mantra "Jo hoga sabke saath hoga". We've always had each other's backs during vivas and exams. 
We've had amazing CRs through the four years who always managed to cover for the whole class in front of teachers. We've had so many talents who made our class proud! 
So here we are at the climax, somewhere deep down wishing this not to be the end! 
Thanks to everyone who helped me survive these 4 years and made them memorable!
I'm gonna miss you all<3
I hope our paths will cross again in the near future❤ 

Love, 
Tejaswini
