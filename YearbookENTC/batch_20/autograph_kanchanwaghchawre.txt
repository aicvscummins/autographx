To Corona-wali Batch,
Since you all remember the "My dad is a police officer" election speech where it all started, here's another one to end the journey.
When my dad told me about Cummins college, I was really angry. I did not want to go to a college whose name I'd never heard.
Also, college is supposed to be "fun"- the kind you can't have in a girls college.
But then he took me to take a look and I saw our seniors have fun- sitting anywhere, laughing anyhow, wearing nightpants to college!
No one to judge. I knew if I was to spend 4 years in one place- this is the where I should be.
And man, the reality was way more fun than what I had seen.

Being the CR was cheery on the top. Although our class was the most inactive one. Whatever little we did, it was with all our hearts.
Everyone was there to cheer irrespective of the level of performances. That right there was our unity. It was never about having most prizes.
Being together was enough. 

Finally, a lot has been said about our class bunking. I won't re-iterate that. Although I opposed bunks a lot- I too wanted days off. 
Stepping down feels like the best decision ever. Without that THE DIV B probably wouldn't have happened.
We were together even when we did not actually meet. Remember this for life guys and let's be together forever.

Here's hoping to meet you all soon.

Loads of Love for all!
