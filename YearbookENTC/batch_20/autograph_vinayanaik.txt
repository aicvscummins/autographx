Hello guys,
Four years in an all girls college was not expected to be great but it wasnâ€™t just great it was super fabulous, empowering and crazy good. One of my best decisions in life. Our class was cherry on top. I am so grateful for this class and the fun and the unity and the awesomeness. We have passed out as legends. We deserve it. 
Master has given all the dobbys a degree, and all dobbys are free.
Stay in touch everyone. All the best for the whole new chapter and many more beautiful chapters to come.
Lastly, I would want to quote:
We are free - The Slaves, 1865.

Lots of love, laughter, freedom,
Vinaya.
