Hello Divison B,
Cheers to these four years we spent together in an all girls college, but our class was which made it real fun.
There is something special about each one in this class, may it be the unity during mass bunks, or the proxies, the Gandhar practices, or the innovation competitions. There were such amazing people in this class, whom i would never forget. Thanks to everyone of you , and let's celebrate these 4 memorable years of our lives. Back down the memory lane I am pretty sure Cummins would be the best part of our lives. We laughed to our fullest and truly enjoyed our engineering journey. I really hope we all stay in touch and meet  #onelasttime. I love you guys . 
 
Love and Love always
Sanika
