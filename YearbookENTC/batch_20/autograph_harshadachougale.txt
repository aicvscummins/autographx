Hi everyone
It was my first experience to be in all girls college ( I know most of yours). It was a great journey. Though we had many groups and batches but we were united as class. Every year we got scoldings from teachers for mass bunking but we were ENTC B. Thanks guys for all the love and support. Kya ek last time exam bunk karein 😅. Love you guys.
All the best...
