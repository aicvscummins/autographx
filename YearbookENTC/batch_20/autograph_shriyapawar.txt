Division B,


There's not one person in our batch or even the teachers who doesn't know about us and our historical mass bunks and unity. But that's not just who we are. We are friends turned into family, we're the class who stood out in every aspect, be it good grades, placements, university admits. There's something about each one of us that'll be in my heart forever. We've all been a small part of each other's lives and helped each other grow. They say people you meet in college always make the deepest impact and that just feels so true today. I hope we're all there at the 10 year reunion and talking about how we've taken over the world. Thank you for being a part of my journey and I can only hope that I've helped you out in yours. All the best to everyone for the next phase of our lives. Always stay in touch <3


Loads of love,
Shriya Pawar
