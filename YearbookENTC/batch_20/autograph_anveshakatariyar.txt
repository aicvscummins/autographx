Dear All,


It was a great four year journey with all of u... Let not the last 2 .5 months tarnish the whole experience.... We have any way lived our college life to the fullest... These end days wouldn't make much of a difference... It was just a conclusion of everything... Which will be missed and be void forever .  Hope we meet for the last time... All the ppl ,before embarking towards a whole new chapter of life. The Work Life.

Before these months... Never ever felt bad about the college being over... It was always there in the mind... That we will conclude as every batch does and be in touch forever 
But we are officially registered in the history.... "THE BATCH of 2020"
Take Care!!



With  Love,
Anvesha
