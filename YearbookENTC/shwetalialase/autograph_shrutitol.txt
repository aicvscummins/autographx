Hey Shwete,
                     from being hostelmates to groupmets to colleagues to bike riders in the rain to Friends ,I had shared a great journey with you. I can not forget all the fun we had in college, class ,office and hostel.I can never forget the chilly night ahe we revised the whole CNS syllabus on our terrace. You are the dictionary of all the international words which I did not know.Stay the same.Love you.
All the best buddy!
