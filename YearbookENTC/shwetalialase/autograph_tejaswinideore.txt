Hey Partner,
From lab partners to project partners, we've come long way . Thank you for caring, for tolerating me, for cheering me up when I almost gave up and thank you for your well arranged notes and those magical last minute revisions <3 
(and thank you for listening Khade sir's long speehes :-P)
I'll miss annoying you over little things!
Wish you all the luck in the world!
