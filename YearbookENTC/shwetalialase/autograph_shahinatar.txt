Shwetaliii, 
        No words can describe what I feel for you. You are always being the best choice of mine in college for every single thing let it be study, outing, doing timepass or eating tasty dishes. You loved me after knowing my bad side as well. Yes, we are very close from being best friends but you are the best friend. Our 3 years of friendship ( you know why 3 years right?) is gonna last forever. Thanks for always being there. I don't  even need to complete a sentence even if I say a single word you just guessed things correctly. Remember the time when we went out for a movie, our hilarious laugh, and also us singing “Bhakti Geet” in every single trip as if we are so sanskari. Wherever we go if we are together we are gonna make it best.  
Cheers to all our trips, all our outings. Cheers to the hostel days of mine. (PS- Missing your handmade maggie more than you).
No need to say stay in touch because you don’t even have an option . 
I love you too.
