Hi Shwetali,
You are very sweet, fun loving and helpful friend. We had a lot of fun in first year and it was always cheerful around you. The dance practice this year was fun for you were correcting my hand moves to clockwise than anti-clockwise. ;p definitely amazing times. I wish you all the success in life.
Much love.
