Hey Shwetali!!!!
   We wouldn't talk much initially. We got to know each other when you used to come at our room for project.
I remember when you stayed at our room for a whole night.It was really fun how we made you to hide from 
metron. And I'm sure you too remember Ashwini's Besan-Haldi moment.
You are a bold and clever person.
Be the same always.
I know you'll do great in whichever field you go.
All the best for your future!!

See you soon in Accenture..
 
    Love,
    Kshitija:)
