Hey Shwetali!
U are an amazing person! Always Jolly and fun loving! We just started to get close ! But whatever times we have spent together you have always helped me no matter what! From paying my snacks bills to boosting me up and checking up on me if i need any help! Its really an honour to have u as my one of my close friends! I m extremely thankful to you for being there for me in my difficult times and listening to my song covers and giving me honest feedback! 
I am a person who speaks less .. i dont remember me calling to check up on you or just casually call u up and have random conversations with you , i m guilty for that . Not only you but to my closest friends i havent really shown as much appreciation as i should have, but i still have a chance! And i will do better pls keep staying by me !
Whenever i remember you i can only recall a chill person and ur epic dialogue “Aye khuliyes kay!!” which has  always made me laugh laugh so hard haha:). I hope you me shahin ashwini shwetali get the same location so that we can have lots and lots of fun together! Im really excited! Hope to meet u soon!


With loads of love,
Anushree:)
