U are an amazing person! All the times when we had few discussions related to academics whenever we bumped into each other and all the roasting of teachers that followed LOL... do u remember?I will miss these moments a lot! U are really helpful and a kind person and thank you for all the help u have given  me! I wish u all the success in life! Stay happy and stay connected!


With love,
Anushree:)
