Vinaya, you are the most amazing person I know. I have had many amazing days with you, starting from selfies to talking about universe. You have so much power over words, I hope to read something that you have written in future and also talk about universe whenever we catch up. Stay the same, you are the best.
P.S Sorry for stealing your pizza,
Love, Shivani Patil
