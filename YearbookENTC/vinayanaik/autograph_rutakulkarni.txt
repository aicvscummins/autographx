Hi, Vinaya!
We got to know about our common interests pretty late in our BTech years but still we got to plan a nice trip with COEP astronomy club and we sure had a lot of fun there. We also discussed on many astrophysics related topics which I loved doing. It was great to know you personally in the past few years…
