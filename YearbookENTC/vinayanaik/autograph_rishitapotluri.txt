Vinaya!
Such fun memories we made, even though very very few ones. 
I love how I could just rant to you out of no where about my internship.😂😂
I could literally blabber bullshit and you would listen to me with such patience. I remember how i was going over to Ayushi's and had dropped you off. You trusted me despite knowing about my driving😂😂😂.
All the best bro.
Stay in touch.❤️
