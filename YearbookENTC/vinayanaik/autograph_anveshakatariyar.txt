Vinaya,
We weren't that great friends in the first year ...though we were in the same batch and the same friend circle..But I would credit the second year and shuffling of batches ..that only a few were left in the B2 Batch and then something clicked(you know what) and we gelled up so well. 
The best person with whom I can be absolutely w/o any filter,you are the first one with whom I share my secrets then obviously a few more know it xP.
I remember the best part of the day was when we sat and discussed every minute details of all the unimportant things....And the dealing with ur and Sonali's obsession for Tarot cards and Horoscope xP.
It was great to know you.
Stay same.Hope u get all happiness and success in life.
Meet me soon.

With  Love,
Anvesha
