Hey Vinaya,  
I remember you used to sit right after me in fy for the exams and the fun we had while writing the papers. We met in the first year, bonded over our common interests and it just happened to click. I loved the small discussion we used to have over fashion and hair and new trends and I am really gonna miss you. Thanks for helping me with notes and assignments and everything. I hope you get all the strength required to fulfill your dreams. 


Wish you lots of love and success, 
Unnati.
