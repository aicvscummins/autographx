Hi.. Vinya..(Not a Spelling mistake..!!)
My First year of engineering was really good with you.
All those theories, fun facts, stories we used to discuss were amazing.
I wish we can do that again someday.
Well, I would like to apologise for special kid thing. And I don't know if we can ever finish the book. But, we gotta try.
I literally salute your patience for taking almost 25-30 pics to get one good picture. I'll Try to watch series you recommended.(Do the same).
Hope we'll meet soon and be in touch afterwards. :p
