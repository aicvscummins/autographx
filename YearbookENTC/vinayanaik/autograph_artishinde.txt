Heyy Vinaya!
When I remember the time I spent with you, I can only recollect the amazing philosophical talks about life that we had after MC lecture and how can I forget mentioning the wonderful Taro card session. I just loved it!
We have spent very less time together but within that small period our frequencies matched so well and I have found the best soul in you.
 I miss all the time that we haven’t got to spend with each other :( Anyways, be in touch and wish you all the best for your future endeavors.


With lots of love
