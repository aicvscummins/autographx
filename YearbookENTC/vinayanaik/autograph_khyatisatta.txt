Heya,
I'm so glad I got to meet you in the first few days of college where we spoke about'Closer' and then went to get that scholarship form signed by the director.
You were an amazing classmate and I just can't help but remember the time when we went to Sahare sir with our project and he behave like we caught him in the middle of something *inapprpriate*
Enjoy your life and keep in touch
Cheers!!
