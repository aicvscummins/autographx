Hey Vinaya! I’m always going to remember you for the amazing singer that you are. The Cummins internship would’ve been a bit more boring if it wasn’t for our random cafeteria conversations. And I definitely couldn’t have dealt with our teachers coming to the office if it wasn’t for you. Stay in touch! All the best for everything!
