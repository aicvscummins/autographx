Hey Vinaya,
I remember when i first met you I never thought that we will be friends.
But im so glad we went on to become the best of friends.
I have enjoyed each and every fun filled discussion we have had on the most bizarre topics-
parallel universe, blackholes, tarot, afterlife etc
You are the only person with whom I can discuss anything and everything.
Thank you for all the fun filled and beautiful memories.
I wish you all the success and happiness in your life.
Keep in touch.
Lots of Love.
And one last thing Never ever change - Always be the same fun loving ,smart and confident Vinaya
