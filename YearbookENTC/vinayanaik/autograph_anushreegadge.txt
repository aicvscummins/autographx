Hey Vinaya!
I am blessed to have a friend like you! I remember how u ,shahin,aditi,anvesha we all celebrated my first  birthday in college and it was really emotional for me coz after 10th that was my first time celebrating with friends! That meant a lot for me! It was a sunday and still you ppl came from so far just for me...it will forever stay in my heart! 
I have never been expressive with my thoughts and this platform is like a golden opportunity for me so this might be a little long one hehe!
Vinaya u are an incredible person , extremely talented , one who always stays with her buddies no matter what! U are my singing buddy and i love ur voice! Its angelic! If it werent you i wont have dared to take part in group singing in Gandhaar and be confident with my voice. U made me realise i can sing well and i should participate so Thanks a ton for that!
U are the reason i fell in love with pizzas. We went to awesome movies together ! U made me realise theres sooo much to enjoy and theres sooo much i was missing out !
I will miss our mall visits and our crazy time trying out different clothes and how bizarre i felt just with the idea that literally everyone comes to mall to try out new clothes click good pictures and leave! LOL! 
Our random walking on FC streets and eating Pizzas and cheesecakes and just street shopping! I will miss these all! Thank you for everything! Lets meet up soon! I still cant believe college is over:(
Have a great life ahead and please please stay in touch! All the best:)


With lots of love,
Anushree.
