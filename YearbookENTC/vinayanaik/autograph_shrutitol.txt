Hey Vinaya,
We say that we did not have much of a bond but we have been a  part of "The Goa trip" and cancelled it so we are friends for sure.
You have a sweet soothing voice and wonderful writing skills.Never leave both of these things. As I suggested if you write a blog , I will be the first subscriber.I also admire how firmly you express your opinion on anything with all the background known.
It was great to have you as a part of this journey.
All the best. Stay in touch! 
And suggest something to Vodafone to improve their network (😜)
