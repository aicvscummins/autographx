Hey! Knowing you has been a joy Sanika. You have such a pleasant and lively aura around you. It automatically makes it so easy to talk to you. We’ve had pretty limited conversations in random places which I do feel bad about. I still remember we were filling in our group details for the mini-project when something about your mobile number came up and I hadn’t saved it. I know it’s a pretty insignificant thing but I felt shitty that I hadn’t saved your number even after 3 years of engineering. And yet here we are today. Fashion show practices gave us another chance to get to know each other and it has been amazing knowing you. Stay in touch! All the best!
