How can I ever forget about our first year physics practicals! That was the start to our friendship.. I had such a great time working on EVS projects and manipulating our physics experiments results. I have so clue how 4 years flew by so fast but I'm so glad they could end with you being the Zeus to my Athena. Although we couldn't walk the ramp together I cherish all our practice sessions and costume designing conversations. You're a true Fashionista! Keep in touch and all the best <3
