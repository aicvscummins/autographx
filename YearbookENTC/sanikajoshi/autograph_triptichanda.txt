Heyyyy Saaanika,
Just thhinking about you and the college ending brings tears to my eyes. Our relationship has changed so much since the first year and I am kicking myself that I did not find you sooner and throw myself on you.
You know, eventhough we might tease you for day dreaming, I think that is one of your best qualities, among so many that make you a truly awesome human being. I love how seriously you take every decidion and thought and person in your life.
Everything is important to you and that is beautiful to see. Just watching you be consumed and inspired by what you are doing, is so great to watch.I can see this immense fire of potential inside you which assures me that whatever you do, pura dil lagake karegi and nobody could do it better than you.
I love you so much Sanika and I am not ready to let you go, so i have decided that I will not. You are stuck with me for life and have to be my friend forever.
All my love
