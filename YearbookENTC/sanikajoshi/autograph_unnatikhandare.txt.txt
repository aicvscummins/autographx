Hey Sanika, 
We were in the same batch and I remember how we used to be the ones always convincing ppl to bunk labs...our time when we used to gossip throughout the tut and then complete the question last minute and rush out. You are a bubbly person and i will miss your gossips.😂 And thank you for introducing us to rotaract it was amazing being a part to that club. 
Much love, 
Unnati.
