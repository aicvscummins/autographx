I can't begin to tell you what I'm gonna miss more about us being in college...
Going to tekdis (You, me and Aniha were the first ones) or doing that one stupid Zumba class we did or just sitting on our gaadis or in Mc'Donalds?
There are so many wonderful memories to reminisce.
Thank you for them. We did do bat-shit crazy stuff, but I wouldn't have it any other way or with anyone else.
I love you and all your sweaters and sweatshirts <3<3
Idc but we're going somewhere before you people leave
