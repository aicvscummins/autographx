Heyyyaaa,
I am glad that we happen to stay in the same hostel otherwise I won’t have known you well. You are very cute when you do things like peeping weirdly from the door or picking random names for you soft toys or talking in a kid like voice or freaking out a night before exams. Thank you for motivating us to study by saying
‘ khup saara portion aahe’ .
Maybe I won’t express it that much but I am sure gonna miss you a lot!


All life’s best to you,
Unnati.
