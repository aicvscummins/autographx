I don't know how to describe you as a person. You are so different. Yes, when I first saw you we didn't get on a right foot, but now when I know you, you are this chubby, cute person roaming hostel corridors when you are bored, very helpful, and hardworking. We didn't spend a lot of time, but whenever we were together it was amazing. I wish we stay like this forever, I won't let you go either, Kidding. Still, you are one of the best person I have met and an amazing friend. I love you. all the best for the future. <3
