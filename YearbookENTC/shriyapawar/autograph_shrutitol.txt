Hey Shriya,
                   I remember how you took lead in the first year to be the CR and you were great .
I wish I could get a little bit of your 'Bindhast' attitude in my life.I always admired how tension free you are in your life….from  listening to teacher's scolding about attendance or not paying attendance in the class to writing apology letter to the HOD just before submitting it!
 I will also remember your advice to smile when you don't know the answer...It helped me in my interviews☺️☺️
Keep smiling and stay in touch..All the best!
