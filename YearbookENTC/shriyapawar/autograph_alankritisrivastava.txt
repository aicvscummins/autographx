Shriya Pawar. Writing this for you is probably one of the toughest things I’ve done because this means we are out of college and going our separate ways. You have been my pillar of strength these four years. Those random walks all in chotti chotti gallis, railway stations, Mood Indigo, our once a year dates..these are just a few of the zillion things I’m going to add in my engineering stories. You’ve been the sole witness to a lot of the crazy and wild things I have done! And you’ve guarded all those stupid, wild secrets with your life. I can’t think of one best memory with you….it’s like a mixture of a gazillion chotu chotu things. It’s the always reaching late for a movie, traveling to the opposite end of the city on a two-wheeler, fighting with you over nothing only because there was never anyone else I could scream at...it is sitting peeche at the naala and just watching life pass by that I will cherish forever. I wish we could both be in Bangalore..but well it is what it is. I love you Shriya Pawar. You’ve been my backbone, my confidant, my safe haven, and most importantly my best friend. And this is definitely not goodbye..it’s a promise of friendship for a lifetime.
