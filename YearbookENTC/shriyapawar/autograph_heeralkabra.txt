Heyy Shriya!
You were one of the coolest CR’s of Div B, always kept the class united! Also, even though we never talked we’ve always shared some crazy dance moves together, for Gandhaar, at the time of freshers, during the GMRT field visit haha! 
Hope we get a chance to catch up someday soon :) Good luck!!!
