Shriya shriya shriya!! You are just the best. I really don't know what I would have done without you in college. Remember the time you took me to buy those heels all the way to camp? We didn't even know each other that well back then. Like how can you be so sweet? And guess what we are going to have more of our differences in the future and get over them because we are staying friends forever. Cool? Thanks for always being there and saving my ass. I love you a lot❤
