Hey Shriya!
Damn I am really disappointed that we did not get to spend more time together. I know we would have had fun. But all the time that we did get to spend I know that I enjoyed every moment.
I was so curious to see how your tentacler were going to turn out. It would have been amazing, I know it.
I can't wait to see what you will go and do out there.
All the best!
