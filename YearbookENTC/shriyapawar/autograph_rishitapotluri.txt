I wonder why we didn't become friends sooner. You are the most reliable person I have ever met.(I am clearly not forgetting how you saved my Dumb-ass :) ). I'll miss all those exam days where I could just be like "Yaar, jo hoga dekhlenge, Shriya bhi hai, voh samhaal legi". Thanks for being the best exam partner I could ask for. Thanks for all that attendance you marked. I love how you treat people as your own despite hardly knowing them.
