Hey <3


I can't think of me having to survive these four years without you being by my side. No matter how bad the situation got you were always there and I can't thank you enough for it.
You've been the one person I know I could count on even in sleep :)


I remember coming to your room and talking about things. Literally from the first vodka sips, we took in the first year filled with the weirdest awkward questions to counting down the last few days--how did we grow up man. We definitely weren't planning on it. 


I don't know how long this college education that we got will last, but I am sure I've made a friend for life.
