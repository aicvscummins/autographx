Hey Shriya!
I have known u since our junior college days and but i hardly got mixed up with other classmates and we didn’t really talk much! Although i really admired you as a confident and bubbly person everytime!! You have this aura of positiveness wherever you go! Also coincidently we were admitted in the same college,same branch , same class...i mean how amazing!! After all this... all i did everytime i bumped into you was smile, wave and say “Hi”! And thats it hehe And feel all awkward and freeze as to what do i say next LOL! But you were the one to break the ice!
I admire how you always stay by the side of ur friends and are really helpful!Also u have a great sense of humour!
 I am glad to have spend all my happy years ryt from our junior college days all the way to engineering ..with you! When i came out of my comfort zone and finally started talking to you i realised you are so down to earth and a kind person! U are really hardworking,i really look up to you...despite staying in hostel which has its own struggles all together , u really managed well ur academics and ur panel duties! Being our class’s CR , u did a great job! U always supported the class and looked what needs to be done!
I will forever remember all the new year , gudipadwa , diwali and holi wishes i got from you ! It meant a lot for me! Even though we didnt talk much ...all these little things made me feel we are still connected! Thanks a lot for being a great classmate and a buddy! I will forever remember these small interactions we had! 
U are an extremely talented individual ! I wish you all the success in life.! Hope to meet you soon to have many more such exciting conversations! Stay in touch and take care:) 


With lots of love,
Anushree.
