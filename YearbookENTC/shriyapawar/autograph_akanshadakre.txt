Hey Shriya,
 
I don't know whether you remember this or not but the first girl in the hostel or college with whom I talked was you, it was you who just started talking with me as I was very shy that day thanks for that and later we shared the same room and became friends. You are very talented and kind-hearted person. I saw how fast you grasp things be it studies or anything else. I admire this the most in you.I enjoyed watching movies, eating Maggie with you late night. I look back on how u used to tease Nikita Tai it was really funny yaar. I and Nikita Tai always used to ask u 'Lagla Ka Tula kuthe ya Padla Ka Kahi Samaan' whenever we hear some voice because you always used to get hurt by falling down and drop things accidentally in rush. I hope so you don't do that now. 
Thanks for all other memories which we had like always giving suggestions on movies, helping me in my studies, revising the topics with me before exams it helped me a lot in my studies. Be happy always and All the best for your future!!❤❤
