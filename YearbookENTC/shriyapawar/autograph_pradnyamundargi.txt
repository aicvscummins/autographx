I honestly don't know where to begin, but the first memory I have of us is running around St. Mary's campus playing chor-police. We drifted from friends to strangers to better friends than we ever were. I know we have had our share of differences but I'm glad we could see past that. I hope this never changes now. The memories we created are priceless. Everytime we clicked a selfie, I am always going to remember us saying "Oh we actually get great pictures together!" Lets stay in touch till the end of time. <3
