Shriyaaaaaaa,
Our best memories are of Goa! I'm so glad we finally went.
We've had our shares of ups and downs but none of it has changed that the fact in my mind that you're a good person. <3 It's kinda impractical to mention all the things we've shared over the past 3 years because there are soooo many so here's a big thanks for being there and making memories! You're always welcome to visit me in Bangalore and I'm always up for "uk" :P hoping to see you there nearly as much as I saw you in the hostel.
High time you guys accept I was your friend in FY xD
Much love <3
