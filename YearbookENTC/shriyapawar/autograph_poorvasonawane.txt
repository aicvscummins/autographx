Hey Shriya,
    We are in same batch since first year. I like the way you smartly handle situations.
You are so sweet and helpful friend and also sabki favourite CR. I remember, in starting days 
of FPL lab, when I was hardly familiar with coding, you helped me lot. Thanks you for everything.
All the best for your future efforts.
With Love,
Poorva.
