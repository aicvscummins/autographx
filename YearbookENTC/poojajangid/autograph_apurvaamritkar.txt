Hey Pooja, 
You are one of the most funny and genuine person that I've ever met. You can never fail to make people laugh. I will always remember our little gossip seshs in the canteen and at that coffee place. I've always admired the way you see almost anything negative in a postive perspective.I will def miss ya. 
Love ya
