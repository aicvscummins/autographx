Hiii Pooja,
We got along a lot between were in the same batch. I can’t really get over the fun gossips with did, the jhols we did during the tutorials, the Jugad we did for writeups and all the last minute viva preparations. I am really gonna miss all of it.
Be the same cool and fire person you are. Wish you success and happiness.
Much love,
Unnati.
