Pooojaaaa, I want to tell the 2050 pooja that 2020 pooja was one of the most gyaaani and jugadu  person  this world could ever have. Bhai tereko sab kaise aata hai?Sab?
Cooking ✔️. Drawing/ Painting and all the artistic stuff✔️, talented ✔️ jugadu ✔️. I still remember calling you at any time of the hour to ask you extremely silly stuff? "pooja gut feeling bata yaar, jau kya mein mumbai, kuch hoga toh nahi? That is how much i need you in my life . Tera no toh emergency contact mein daalke rakha a.
We had that unsaid rule, we never talked about it, but starting from the first exam which we gave till the last, we never started the exam before wishing each, and you would just communicate with me dur se and you used to calm me down.
Aageke exams ke liye kaun karega yaar meko shant?
Bhai, koi dost hogi kya kisiki jo exam mein copy karne ke liye force karre, " abbey sanika chutiya yeh dekh 5 mark ka hein jaldiiiiiiiii likh" . Hahahaha. I will never forget that day.
And i swear i would never have the courage to do all the things which i did, if you were not with me.
I know bohot machyayegi tu kuch saalo mein.
apne iss chutiya dost ko bhuli, toh peet jayegi.
