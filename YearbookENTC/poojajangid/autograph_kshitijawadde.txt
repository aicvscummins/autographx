Dear Pooja,
   You are such a bold person. We were in same batch in 2nd and 3rd year. I still remember how we abused PPK at hostel after lunch but 
I don't remember the reason behind it. I'll always cherish the memories we have shared in hostel ,mess and in college.
And off course our all time sentences " Ghar jaa rahi hai" "Common lete hai yr pakka" "Kitna padhna hua re tera" ....
I'm sure you are going to do great in your life. 
All the best for your future!!
Stay in contact!!
 
    Love,
    Kshitija:)
