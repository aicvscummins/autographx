Hiii Pooja!
Baap re, just thinking about all the things that I want to say to you, I realised that there would not be any space left for anybody else.
You have been my other half throughout and you were the perfect college girlfriend that I could have asked for.
The best part about us was that regardless of how many fights we had and jitna bhi rona dhona hua, I always knew that whatever I did, you would always have my back.
The endless noghts, the dance parties, the cards and the pranks and the birthdays and the gossips, even this list is endless.
The best way I can put it I love you babe and I will miss you the most.
This is definitely not the end
