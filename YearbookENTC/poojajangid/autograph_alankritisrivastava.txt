Hey Pooja, it’s been amazing having you in our class. You played a major role in most of the successful mass bunks. I like how confident and strong opinionated you are. And you have an amazing fashion sense. Oh! I also love your hair. I’m glad we could be a part of each other’s graduation journey. All the best for everything the future holds!
