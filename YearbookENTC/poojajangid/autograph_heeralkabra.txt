Dearest Pooja,


My marwadi fellow, from the freshers party to the glow party, we have come a long way!
Tutorials, practicals, lectures or anything in college generally would not have been as crazy and as dramatic as it was with you! Our constant source of gossip and entertainment, my defaulter buddy, someone who has made me laugh like a maniac almost everyday!
Will miss buying pattice and getting home food for you so much, our love for clothes and of course all your maha jugaadu/Jangid ideas!
You have always been the protector of our group, ready to fight with anyone for anyone!
SO much to say, but the amount of time we have chilled together cannot be put in words but it's something I will treasure all my life, just like you my friend! 


Love you forever, 
Heeral
