Pooja,
Baring the first semester we have always been together, same hostel,same class, same batch, same mess,same project group..lol!(aur bhi similarities hogi).You have been there with me in thick and thin,in fun and sorrow...The one I need the most in hostel.We have done all kind of shits together in Hostel and Project reviews.You were almost a stranger in the first semester and then we sang together and the rest is history.Hope u get all happiness and success in life.Stay same and Stay in Touch. 
With tons of Love,
Anvesha
