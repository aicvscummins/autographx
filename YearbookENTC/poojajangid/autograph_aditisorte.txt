Hiii.
I still remember the day when Anvesha called to do the project with me..
I was like Pooja? I have not talked to her ever..Why her?
But, you know, when we actually started working, it was the best.
You were just the right person for it. 
Our jugads, your " very helpful friends" and our last minute preparations, It was so much fun..
All the best for your future and stay in touch.
