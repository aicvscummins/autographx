 Shraddha!!

     I never thought the girl with whom i shared the bench in college will become so important to me!!!
    I will always miss us!!! I know u will be always there for me. You are one of the best thing that I have got from Cummins.
  I wish we would have got the last chance to spend some precious moments of gandhar, farewell, and all the things once again, 
    but never mind we will meet soon and i know our bond will be always the same!!!
   Lets meet soon buddie!!!
   And ha I wish that we get one more chance to cherrish new memories(and also some pictures) in new city(you know what i mean to say).......
     I LOVE U :-)
